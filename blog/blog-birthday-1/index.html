      <h1>Happy birthday to this blog—thoughts and plots!</h1>
      <div class="date">20 May 2025</div>
<p>It has been almost exactly a year since I finished my batch at the
Recurse Center, and a little over a year since I started <del>doing
stuff and bragging about it</del> sharing and writing up my projects
publicly on this site.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure that I’d want to—or manage to—write consistently, much
less publish, but I actually kind of have?</p>
<h2 id="some-plots-in-no-particular-order">Some plots, in no particular
order</h2>

<p>My first post, a meta-post on the site itself, was on May 19 last
year. Then crickets, for months.</p>
<p>What changed in mid-September—why nothing for months, and then a
whole cluster of posts? That was directly attributable to a September 2
hang with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="TODO">cceckamn</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="TODO">shae</a>, who
asked a bunch of questions about my flipdots project and then strongly
encouraged me to write about it. As you can see, having even just that
one post up unblocked the dam, so to speak.</p>
<p>What happened in November? Some family visits, some travel, some
being sick. Some working on projects but not writing about them. It’s
also interesting (to me!) to see my publication rate decelerate towards
the end of January as my job hunt and some contracting work—and later,
employment—ramped up. I’ve continued to attend a weekly writing group
that’s helped keep at least a little continued writing momentum.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t actually believe that “time spent writing”
correlates to “number of words published” or “timing of words
published”; my writing timing these days is still pretty scattered and
unpredictable, which is something I’m actively frustrated by and
focusing on. I don’t have a great way to show that here, so you’ll have
to take my word for it.</p>
<hr />
<p>What have I been writing about? Good question. I haven’t really
figured out my tag game here<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, so this wordcloud of
tags from all the posts isn’t necessarily a <em>great</em> view into it,
but it is <em>a</em> view:</p>

<p>A wordcloud of all the words in all the posts provides a more verbose
but not necessarily better (!) view:</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-in-no-particular-order">Some thoughts, in no
particular order</h2>
<h3 id="the-good">The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing is <em>fun</em>. I did it a whole lot when I was younger,
then took a bit of a break, and have really loved getting back to
it—both for myself, and as a means of connection with various parts of
my community.</li>
<li>Having a dedicated draft-reader and thumbs-up-giver has been
awesome. Shoutout to AF, who has done the final read of many a post, and
provided the confirmation that at least one other person (her!) finds
the thing worth reading. Bonus points for being willing to do this at
stupid-o’clock, when I said I’d be done hours before.</li>
<li>Having a dedicated cheerleading squad to encourage the writing-up of
projects has been key. Hat tip especially to Charles and Shae, but also
any number of Recursers (and others!) who’ve chatted about an
in-progress project with me and encouraged me to write it up. Shae and
Charles were the impetus for my first post on FlipDots, which got such a
great reception that it provided the dopamine runway for the next
several posts. Shae’s mantra is “Do something, brag about it” which is a
good mantra, but he also embodies “When your friends do things, brag
about them” (and/or, encourage them to brag about themselves) which I’ve
found particularly useful when it comes to writing.</li>
<li>Having a dedicated and enthusiastic audience. Most of my posts are
written with at least one specific person in mind who I think would
appreciate the project—a different person based on the post!—and while
it has been fun to share with them, it has also been affirming to
feedback from folks in the RC Zulip. Sure, I write for me, but I don’t
<em>only</em> write for me.</li>
<li>My original goal with the structure of the website was to allow me
to write posts in markdown, publish them myself, and get out of my own
way—and I’ll say that has worked out pretty well. I have spent
relatively little time changing out the structure or function of the
site itself, relative to the time I’ve spent writing/editing. Through a
rough Vibes measurement, I’ve managed to follow cceckman’s investment
blogging protocol (IBP)
(https://cceckman.com/writing/publish-then-program/) pretty well.</li>
<li>Weekly writing group has been lovely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-neutral">The neutral</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The lower the bar I set for any individual post, the greater the
chance I hit publish and move on</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I stare down something that I want to</p></li>
<li><p>Digging out of project backlog hell is…kinda hell. I am not
particularly good at it. I would not say that my rate of writing up
projects out-paces my rate of doing projects. Oh well!</p></li>
<li><p>I have written a lot more words than I have published, and many
of the words that have not seen the light of publishing have gone a bit
off the rails in snarkiness. While it feels good to write them, it has
also felt good to <em>not</em> publish them.</p></li>
<li><p>It was kind of a joke that I ended up writing my own static site
host whatever todo, but also, now that I’m leaning into that <a
href="../houseplant-programming/">houseplant programming 🪴</a> life, I
don’t feel even a little bit weird about it. I went from “hm, probably
can’t think of this as anything other than hacky until i pull out the
publishing bit into its own library” to “i feel proud of how lightweight
the infrastructure is that lets me Just Write and Just Publish without
having to faff about with html on the reg (or, heaven forfend, someone
else’s templated static site hosting service!).</p></li>
<li><p>Having this site as a place to post to let me shift my project
mindset from a “think up project, do project, abandon project in weird
state, feel guilty about not completing project, etc” lousy cycle to a
<a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development">content-driven
development</a> mindset.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-unending-struggle">The unending struggle</h3>
<ul>
<li>I still really struggle with exactly how candid to be here, and
about which parts of my life. Focusing on the tech projects helps set a
bit of a boundary, but still. I’m not quite as personally open as some
of the tech/art writers I most admire, and I’m not sure if/when that
will change. At heart I’m still a livejournal kid, with a
fully-locked-down journal, and it feels weird to be writing out into the
fully-open ether.</li>
<li>Ditto tone. I haven’t quite figured out a stable one. Or a stable
audience, and level of detail for tech write-ups.</li>
<li>Ditto references to non-hyper-local stuff. There’s a lot of really
exquisitely awful stuff that is happening with appalling rapidity, and I
don’t know how to write about it, so I…mostly haven’t. But I admire the
folks who do.</li>
<li>I also haven’t figured out how not to get bogged down in an endless
loop of editing and revising. It would be nice to tighten up the “mind
dump” to “publish” pipeline.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-sum">In sum</h2>
<p>Even if I never publish another post to this site, I feel good about
how much I’ve published this year alone. The experiment was a win, and
I’d encourage anyone on the fence to try it for themselves.[^start]</p>
<p>Last but not least, thank you for reading!</p>
<p>[^start] Not sure how to start? I recommend <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="www.tinylogger.com">tinylogger</a>! I use it to drafting my posts
and then move them to a separate site to publish, but it supports
publishing directly from there!</p>
