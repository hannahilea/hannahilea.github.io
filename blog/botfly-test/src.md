In a tech-community forum recently, I encountered non-transparent automated behavior that really, *really* annoyed me. After confirming that my spidey senses were correct, and that this user was regularly and non-transparently performing and benefiting from automated behavior in the forum, I spent some time trying to figure out why exactly I was *so* annoyed by it. 

I'm not going to write about that specific situation here---case study follow-up post when?---but I did come up with a basic set of [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test)-style criteria for determining if automated behavior is distasteful within the community it inhabits. 


<div class="centered-children">

 <h3 style="text-align: center">The Botfly Test</h3>

When a user programs an account to interact in an online community in automated ways:

1. Is the account **transparent** about being a bot when it performs an action?

2. Does the account provide a **prosocial** service to the community it inhabits?

3. Is the user **unselfish** in how they benefit from the value generated by their automated account?

If the answer to one or more of these is "no," they fail the test---the bot they've programmed is parasitic to the community it inhabits.

</div></div>

The Botfly Test provides *minimum standards* for demonstrating prosocial community behavior. A bot that passes this test isn't necessarily of benefit to the community, but a bot that fails this test definitely isn't.

Or, more personally: if a bot passes the test, it may annoy me---if it fails the test, it almost CERTAINLY annoys me.

Notably:

- **If all answers aren't a definitive "yes," the test is failed.**

    Some of these questions are clearly open to interpretation, and/or depend on the community at hand. If you have to jump through hoops to explain why a bot passes, it does not pass.

- **Community context matters: Automated behavior that passes the test in one community may fail in another.**

    The norms of a given community---both written guidelines and typical human-human and human-bot interactions---may affect the answers to the Botfly Test, so the criteria must be applied to a bot's actions **as relate to the given community or sub-community**.

    For example, sufficient transparency in one community ("including 'bot' in the username") may not be sufficient in another; a "service" to one community might be an annoyance in another; the value (karma/points/etc) accrued by actions may boost an account's reach in one community but have no effect in another.
    
    My personal definition of "service" includes "providing joy", so bots like Reddit's haiku-bot[TODO-link] pass my personal "prosocial service" test---but in a forum devoted to sparsely sharing actionable facts that lead to on-call responses from real humans, a haiku-bot might be an active anti-social hindrence.

- **This test is a minimal criteria test. Passing it does not mean the bot should continue to exist in its current form.**

    For example, test-passing bot behavior in one community may actively be causing harm in another community---which is still bad, and antisocial! The Botfly Test is a *starting point* for assessing antisocial automated behavior.

- **This test is designed for communities that are themselves prosocial.**

    You know what doesn't annoy me? People using their powers of programming automation for good, to disrupt harmful and cruel activities. 

The choice of test name is more than just a cute use of a word that contains "bot"; [botflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botfly) are a type of parasitic fly who lay their larvae to incubate and hatch under the skin of mammals---human and non-human alike. While they aren't deadly, they are prettttttty gross, and a good response to encountering one is to evict it. Identifying and removing botfy larvae improves the health of the affected individual and therefore also the overall health of its community.[^botfly]

[^botfly]: Okay, okay, `[citation needed]` on that last fact! That said, this has been true in my personal experience, and a cursory lit review indicate the trend holds.

## FAQs

**Q:** *Why does it matter if a user in a community has pre-programmed automated interactions in the form of a bot? I think that's totally fine!*</br>
**A:** Yeah, that's a valid question. I think it comes down to reciprocity, scale of influence, and limiting harm. 

Automations can be performed on a super-human scale, and their outputs (a flood of comments in support of a specific idea, downvoting any post that is counter to their programmer's impressions,  and used to influence the very real feelings and very real downstream actions of the rest of the community. It is therefore important for other community participants to be able to assess their interlocutor.

Even so, in a virtual community of possible-dogs, a single dog programming fifty (or fifty thousand) bot accounts to reply "bark" every time someone else writes about a cat has different results based on whether that bot is a botfly or is instead transparent. An errant user who encounters those barks and cannot immediately tell that they were generated by a single other participant might think that that cats are particularly objectionable to everyone else in the community---which might be true, but also, might not! Meanwhile, if that viewer can tell that the responses were all pre-programmed, they may still be affected by it, but at least will have a better inherent understanding of the situation. (And, in the same way that a single user blanketing a forum with the same copy-pasted response may be unwelcome in that community, the visibility of such automated posts may lead to updating community norms around acceptable automated behavior within that space.)

**Q:** *So I've unintentionally **created** a bot that fails the Botfly Test---what now?*</br>
**A:** Easy: Disable it. Bam. You know what's better than introducing an annoying and potentially harmful agent into a community? Not introducing an annoying and potentially harmful agent into a community.

**Q:** *No, but, like, I really think my bot should continue to exist, and I swear I am acting in good faith here?*</br>
**A:** Cool, figure out which pieces of the test it fails, and make them pass: Be transparent that your bot is a bot, make sure it isn't stepping on toes or causing harm, tweak the parameters of what it posts or how often it posts or the language of how it posts, etc. Make sure that any potential conflict-of-interest behavior that could be perceived to benefit you is split out so that it does not benefit you, e.g. by creating separate accounts for your manual vs automated interactions.

**Q:** *So I've **found** a bot that fails the Botfly Test---what now? *</br>
**A:**  Well, the test is about annoyance. So maybe you just be annoyed? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

More seriously: reach out to the author (if you can identify them) and kindly let them know, and if they are well-intentioned and acting in good faith, they will address it.

Or if it is more than just annoying (causing harm or otherwise violating community practices), take it to a mod.

Or make sure the rest of the community is aware that a user that they have been *responding* to as if it were an individual human posting 

...or you could obsess about it and then write up a ridiculous number of words about the situation and then delete most of them and turn the remainder into a set of criteria that you share as a blog post, thereby soothing your peevish soul?

**Q:** I don't want to think this hard. Is there a sniff test I could use instead?
**A:** 

## Bonus annecdote

 When I was a kid my family adopted a pair of barn kittens, and the kittens both had botflies. Never fear, once the botflies had been removed the kittens grew up into healthy, cute, pro-social kitties! 
 
 Here they are immediately after treatment.
