# Playing with "driven development": spite, muffins, and more

A few weeks ago, <a class="impersonal" href="https://www.recurse.com/about">Recurser</a> friend Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya
published <a class="impersonal" href="https://ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development">Making progress on side projects with content-driven development</a>, an excellent write-up about Doing Stuff in order to be able to Share About Having Done Stuffâ„¢. You should read it!

Unfortunately for me, her denomination of "Content-driven development" tripped some switch in my brain, and since then a rotating slate of "X-driven development" variations have taken over. I started with obsessing over spite-driven development (SDD), am currently on a dopamine-driven development (DDD) kick, and have (today) shifted to a rapidly changing moment-by-moment characterization of my actions: feed-the-cat-driven development (FCDD)! Cofeeshop-driven development (CDD)! Beat-the-rain-home-driven development (BRHDD)!  Perhaps writing about it will help me keep the situation in check, before it becomes my whole personality?[^personality] We can only hope. In the meantime, my current approach, as I write this, is muffin-driven development (MDD).[^MDD] 

I've started using DDD and SDD conversationally, and folks are running with it in a delightful way---both sharing their own examples of spite-driven development and coining new ones (crisis-driven development!). I hope that XDDs become part of popular parlance, and to read about more XDDs in the near future.

## What is a "driven development", anyway?

Many software engineers (and possibly *only* software engineers?) are familiar with a process called  <a class="impersonal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">*test-driven development*(TDD). TDD is the OG "driven development": it is a well-known approach to software engineering that defines both a specific approach to writing code (write a failing test, see that it fails, write the code to make the test pass, write the next failing test, etc ad nauseum) and a general approach to software development that emphasizes testing *units of behavior* rather than units of code.[^TDDfeels]

TDD is part of the gestalt enough that new -DD phrases: there's a reason Nicole's "content-driven development" was so mentally sticky, and that I have said "spite-driven development" to a number of software folks, with no additional definition, and been regaled with their own SDD experiences.

If the *X*-driven development naming is a formal thing, I'm not aware of it---and in the spirit of "if you don't do a lit review, you can't feel so discouraged by prior art that you don't give it a try yourself!"[^litreview] No, just kidding---but a quick search shows me that, as I suspected, it doesn't seem to be a widespread naming approach. There are at least a couple less prevalent software engineering practices pattern-matched on TDD in definition and naming, but nothing sweeping.

Also, there's no reason this needs to be a software engineering thing: in the same way that test-driven development can be applied to any number of other non-software domains (devising a rubric for your students' end-of-unit essays; picking a metric with which to evaluate your microbiology experiment; etc)[^TDDdomains], there's no reason any other DD shouldn't also bridge the nominal engineering/non-engineering boundary.

[^TDDfeels]: I've found that many engineers seem to have strong opinions about whether TDD is "good or not," which is a generalization that I don't think is particularly useful. I also think TDD hate is often misdirected and comes after not following the actual practices! Early in my career, the company I worked at brought in a coach to give the engineering team a multi-day TDD workshop. At the time I was too junior to have strong opinions about it; now that I've experienced a bunch of different software development goals and contextual environments, I feel strongly that is extremely useful in the right contexts, and extremely not useful in others.

## Okay, so what qualifies something as a "driven development"?

While I think it is *funny* to turn basically any noun into a DD (see also: muffin-driven development!), I think the DDs that most resonate with me as an actual approach need to do at least one of the following:

1. Literally engage your efforts (i.e., development!), i.e. some action/unit of progress/etc must occur as a result of the framework, and/or
2. Literally motivate (i.e. drive!) the efforts. Just setting a scene isn't enough
3. Provide an operating scaffold for working through steps towards a goal, and/or
4. Provide a thought framework for reinterpreting a goal in a way that makes it achievable, and/or
5. Be specific enough to actually drive concrete, specific actions, and/or
6. Gets the practitioner into a flow-state: provides enough structure that "am i done with this current task?" and "how will i know if i am done with the current effort?" are easy to answer.

The following (brainstormed!) list therefore meets this criteria:
   - Nicole's content-driven development
   - Dopamine-driven development: if i do X, i will be given (attention/recognition/praise)
   - Spite-driven development: they said i couldn't do it, but i did it! [TODO: tiktok meme link] I am doing this to prove them wrong.
   - Crisis-driven development and/or panic-driven development: I need to do *something*, so i've done *something*. 
   - Insomnia-driven development (credit CCEckman)[TODO link]
   - Hammock-driven development: I will do the minimum of what needs doing to get me to the point where I can be in a hammock
    - Speedrun-driven development: I learned a new skill! Pairs nicely with D{opamine}DD and/or S{pite}DD.
    - Checkbox-driven development: Basically another flavor of DDD, but one where the tasks are known up front so can be written down and then checked off. See also: to do lists, pull request <a class="impersonal" href="TODO">punch lists</a>.  
 
These do not (although you could probably convince me, if you gave a better description than my intuitive understanding!):
- Doomscroll-driven development: Doomscrolling takes time, but also, no intentional tasks have been accomplished (unless, of course, you have an active goal of "read X headlines" or "spend X hours being distracted)
- Calm-driven development doesn't count, as no resultant action is encouraged by "calm". Chaos-driven development, on the other hand, counts, as long as "chaos" is what is powering the resultant action

Like TDD, there's a time and a place for each approach; DDs can be used simultaneously. If *X* is driving your development, you are practicing *X*DD. 

## FAQs

**Q:** *Ooh, I have a great idea for a DD! What now?*</br>
**A:** Bring it to life by using it! Or write it up in a blog post of your own (and share the link with me, please!)


**Q:** *From the title, I was lead to believe that this post would focus on spite-driven development---what gives?*</br>
**A:** Yeah, that's what I thought too, before writing it. Turns out I had a lot of other stuff to say first, and think that the phrase "spite-driven development" actually is fairly intuitive---if you've never built something purely because someone else was a hater, keep an eye out for your opportunity to do so! :) [TODO: quote RC Chris here?] 

**Q:** *Okay, but I have a job to do. What about, like, paycheck-driven development? Or healthcare-driven development?*</br>
**A:** Those are totally fine DDs if they work for you! Personally, I don't find they meet the "specific enough to drive my actions" criteria, despite being one of many general motivations.


**Q:** *It seems like an awful lot of these overlap. Or like you'd use multiple at once.*</br>
**A:** That isn't a question, but you're totally right. For example, I am often powered by both DDD and TDD! I contain multitudes. You probably do too.

**Q:** *I have a really cool idea for one: string-theory driven development! But the acronym is...not ideal. What gives?*</br>
**A:** That's on you, friend. I have confidence that you can use a trusty thesaurus to find an alternate name. Or don't, and own it!

## A short brianstorm of DDs
- PDD: Procrastination-driven development. This is a dangerous one if unrecognized, but also a highly productive one that (if part of an OSS community or a larger tech org) exchanges apparent productivv praise at the expense of personal progress towards whatever is being procrastinatted from. If wielded strategically, it can be used to make progress towards two separate goals, by avoiding one in service of the other and then switching back as the next task up becomes less desirable.
- TrDD: Troll-driven development.
- LDD: Love-driven development (or GDD---gift-driven)
- DDD: Dopamine-driven development. Umbrella term, a bit. Differs depending on the person and task---for me, can come from the praise of sharing it (i.e., overlaps with Maddie's content-driven development). Related DDs: Checklist-driven development, Carrot-driven development.
- Speedrun-driven development. You've learned a new skill! Congrats! Now you apply it as quickly as possible to everything you can pattern match against. (How have I done this/seen this done? A winning change to a repository configuration; a pattern in which clicks were caused in audio due to erroneously jumping params; learning a new part of a large and complex system, and then going in and fixing as many [now] low-hanging bugs as touch it.  

[^personality]: Get-it-out-of-my-brain-driven development (GIOMBDD)

[^MDD]: I chose a time to make <a class="impersonal" href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/10/morning-glory-breakfast-cake">muffins</a> that cut a liiiiiiittle too close to the Publication Accountabilibuddies session I frequent, such that I am only now coming off the adrenaline of getting them in the oven in time. The next step is to write as much as possible before the oven timer goes off. How will I know I'm done? There will be words on my page AND a muffin to consume. Muffin-driven development!

[^maddie]: All of her writing is excellent, I recommend checking out other posts.

[^litreview]: ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€

[^TDDdomains]: Okay okay, I would not take this *literally*---but it is possible to imagine what might happen if the test you are doing is broken without making it physically break, and therefore electrocuting yourself/using moldy fruit/FOO. The "understand what a failing case would look like so that you will know definitely that you have completed your task in a way that is NOT failing" point stands!
