      <h1>Dopamine-driven development (DDD), spite-driven development (SDD), and other DDs</h1>
      <p>
        A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">Recurser</a> friend Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya published
        <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development"
          >Making progress on side projects with content-driven development</a
        >, an excellent write-up about Doing Stuff in order to be able to Share About Having Done Stuff™. You should read it!

      <p>
        Unfortunately for me, her denomination of “Content-driven development” tripped some switch in my brain, and since then a rotating
        slate of “X-driven development” variations have taken over. I started with obsessing over spite-driven development (SDD), am
        currently on a dopamine-driven development (DDD) kick, and have (today) shifted to a rapidly changing moment-by-moment
        characterization of my actions: feed-the-cat-driven development (FCDD)! Coffee-shop-driven development (CSDD)!
        Beat-the-rain-home-driven development (BRHDD)! Perhaps writing about it will help me keep the situation in check, before it becomes
        my whole personality?<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We can only hope. In the
        meantime, I am writing this post following muffin-driven development (MDD).<a

      <h2 id="what-is-a-driven-development-anyway">What is a “driven development”, anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Many software engineers (and possibly <em>only</em> software engineers?) are familiar with a process called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"><em>test-driven development</em> (TDD)</a>. TDD is the OG “driven
        development”: it defines both a specific approach to writing code (write a failing test, see that it fails, write the code to make
        the test pass, write the next failing test, repeat ad nauseam) and a general approach to software development that emphasizes
        testing <em>units of behavior</em> rather than units of code.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>3</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        TDD is part of the gestalt; there’s a reason Nicole’s “content-driven development” was so mentally sticky, and that when I have said
        “spite-driven development” to a number of software folks, I have immediately been regaled with their own relevant experiences, no
        additional explanation necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I’m aware, the “<em>X</em>-driven development” pattern isn’t a widespread naming approach. There are at least a couple
        less prevalent software engineering practices pattern-matched on TDD in definition and naming, but nothing sweeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, there’s no reason this needs to be a software engineering thing: in the same way that test-driven development can be applied
        to any number of other non-software domains (devising a rubric for your students’ end-of-unit essays; picking a metric with which to
        evaluate your microbiology experiment; etc)<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a
        >, there’s no reason any other DD shouldn’t also bridge the nominal engineering/non-engineering boundary.
      </p>
      <h2 id="proposed-driven-development-criteria">Proposed “driven development” criteria</h2>
      <p>
        While it’s fun to turn basically any noun into a DD (see also: muffin-driven development!), I think the DDs that most resonate with
        me (and feel like actual techniques) meet at least some of the following requirements:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Leads to (and/or actively motivates) effort on the part of the practitioner, i.e. some action/unit of progress/etc must occur as a
          result of the technique that would not occur absent it, and/or
        </li>
        <li>Provide a thought framework for reinterpreting a goal in a way that makes it achievable, and/or</li>
        <li>Provides an operating scaffold for working through steps towards that goal.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In short, “<em>X</em>-driven development” must aid the practitioner in making desired progress towards some goal, by means of
        <em>X</em>. If <em>X</em> is driving your development, you are practicing <em>X</em>DD.
      </p>
      <p>Like TDD, there’s a time and a place for each approach, and multiple DDs can be used simultaneously.</p>
      <h2 id="x-driven-development-examples">X-driven development examples</h2>
      <p>Some DDs I’ve identified as using most often myself, in no particular order:</p>
      <h4 id="dopamine-driven-development-ddd">Dopamine-driven development (DDD)</h4>
      <p>
        If you accomplish a task in a particular way, you will be given some combination of attention, recognition, and/or praise; if you
        break it down further into specific subtasks, you’ll maximize the amount or type of praise per unit of work. DDD is a
        super-technique that overlaps with many niche driven-developments; for example, Nicole’s content-driven development can be a subtype
        of dopamine-driven development.
      </p>
      <h4 id="checkbox-driven-development-chdd">Checkbox-driven development (ChDD)</h4>
      <p>
        Another flavor of DDD, but one where the tasks are known relatively well up front so that they can be written down ahead of time and
        then checked off systematically. ChDD encourages breaking tasks down into stupidly small units, so that progress through the list
        feels smooth and positively reinforcing. See also: <a href="../make-a-list">First things first: Make a list</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="procrastination-driven-development-pdd">Procrastination-driven development (PDD)</h4>
      <p>
        This is a dangerous one if unrecognized, as it is a variation of DDD that runs counter to the most important task on your task list.
        If wielded strategically, however, it can be used to make progress towards two separate goals, by avoiding one in service of the
        other and then switching back as the next task up becomes less desirable. For example, instead of doing my laundry, I am stalling by
        editing this post.
      </p>
      <h4 id="spite-driven-development-sdd">Spite-driven development (SDD)</h4>
      <p>
        Need I define this one? Everyone I’ve mentioned it to has their own example of it; I’ve love to just list those here, but they were
        discussed confidentially SO ask your friends about this. They will surely have their own examples.
      </p>
      <p>The overarching theme is one of</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>They said that I couldn’t do it, so I went and did it</p>
        <p>– Connor Price</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        and/or “I am doing this to prove them (the great them) wrong”, and/or “they said not to do it this way so I did it this way”, and/or
        “I warned you that this will go badly and you said to do it anyway” , and/or … you get the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have never experienced SDD, congrats, you must be exceptionally forgiving (or exceptionally disengaged, in a probably good
        way!). Also, consider giving it a go sometime, it can be pretty fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you realize that you’re practicing SDD regularly, you may want to consider an attitude readjustment or a job and/or community
        change.
      </p>
      <h4 id="speedrun-driven-development-srdd">Speedrun-driven development (SrDD)</h4>
      <p>You’ve learned a new skill! Congrats! Now you apply it as quickly as possible to everything you can pattern match against.</p>
      <p>
        SrDD is a subtype of DDD, and can pair nicely with SDD on occasion. For example, I once spent a Certain Amount of Time (on the order
        of days) investigating how a particular type of audio artifact (click) was being introduced by one of my team’s algorithms; it took
        me a while to understand the underlying pattern, but once I did I was able to solve a bunch of similar bugs (both filed and
        un-filed) in a relatively short period of time. Whew. Exhilarating!
      </p>
      <h4 id="swear-driven-development-swdd">Swear-driven development (SwDD)</h4>
      <p>
        Welp, the deadline is tomorrow, regardless of how long you gave yourself to work on it. Better cut some scope, cut some
        expectations, and use the power of pure adrenaline—and some well-timed expletives—to Get. It. Done. Also encountered if you have
        limited time booked on a piece of equipment, and need to (random crazy example) cut a certain number of pieces on the laser cutter
        in a too-short amount of time. (Can pair nicely with content-driven development, if the task involves some flavor of presentation.)
        If wielded adeptly, can stem from initial anti-patterns such as hanger-driven development, and under-the-thumb-of-capitalism-driven
        development.
      </p>
      <h4 id="dancing-driven-development-ddd">Dancing-driven development (DDD)</h4>
      <p>
        You’re feeling sluggish about working on a fairly mundane and repetitive task, but you put on a jam and now you can’t help but power
        through it. Often involves head-bobbing and chair dancing; can be counter-productive if the music is too good, so an effective
        practitioner must balance the chosen music against the current task.
      </p>
      <h4 id="service-driven-development-srvdd">Service-driven development (SrvDD)</h4>
      <p>
        Someone in your community needs or wants something, and you know how to make it happen for them! For me, this often shows up when
        making a present or acting as tech support. When used as the target of PDD, SrvDD can be a double-edged sword. (Alternative name:
        love-driven development (LDD).)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
      <p>
        …and those are my big ones! I’ve found it useful to classify my motivations like this; it has been helping me provide a sanity-check
        about the goal of a given task, as well as help me recognize when I’ve unintentionally gone off-task. I’ve also found that DD
        terminology does a nice job of succinctly communicating my current state to others. It’ll be interesting to see if I feel like using
        the terminology longer term, or if it’s just a short-term meme.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve started using DDD and SDD conversationally, and folks in my circles have run with it in delightful ways—both by sharing their
        own examples of spite-driven development (it’s the one that seems to stand out!!) and by coining new “driven development”
        techniques. Keep ’em coming!

      <h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> <em>Ooh, I have a great idea for a DD! What now?</em><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> Bring it to life by using it! And/or write it up in a blog post of your own (and share the link with me,
        please)!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        <em>Okay, but I have a job to do. What about, like, paycheck-driven development? Or healthcare-driven development?</em><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> Those are great DDs if they work for you! Personally I find that I usually need a more specific technique to
        drive my efforts on an minute-by-minute basis, but it’s all context dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        <em
          >It seems like an awful lot of these overlap, or maybe are even exactly the same, with a different name. Or like you’d use
          multiple at once.</em
        ><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> That isn’t a question, but you’re totally right. For example, I am often powered by both DDD and TDD, with an
        occasional background smattering of SDD! I contain multitudes. You probably do too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        <em>I have a really cool idea for one: string-theory driven development! But the acronym is…not ideal. What gives?</em><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> That’s on you, friend. I have confidence that you can use a trusty thesaurus to find an alternate name. Or
        don’t, and own it!

              I’ve found that many engineers seem to have strong opinions about whether TDD is “good or not,” which is a generalization that
              I don’t think is particularly useful. I also think TDD hate is often misdirected and comes after not following the actual
              practices! Early in my career, the company I worked at brought in a coach to give the engineering team a multi-day TDD
              workshop. At the time I was too junior to have strong opinions about it; now that I’ve experienced a bunch of different
              software development goals and contextual environments, I feel strongly that is extremely useful in the right contexts, and
              extremely not useful in others.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              Okay okay, I would not necessarily take TDD <em>literally</em> in many domains—but it is certainly possible to think through
              the “what-ifs” to understand what a failing case would look like, and then what a successful case looks like. And it seems
              like (from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD wikipedia page</a>) this cross-domain
              adoption is something that folks already do. Good!<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
