          <p>Motivation</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Didn’t want to punch by hand!</li>
            <li>Also, have seen videos by FOO and BAR, took the “automate it?” as a challenge</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Disclaimer: not the only person to do some form of automated punch card generation. Intentionally didn’t look this up before getting started, because it seemed like it would be fun and i didn’t want to be discouraged.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Here are some other folks who’ve done similar (w/ differences)—e.g., seem to focus on the “auto punch” aspect, where i’m more interested in “quality check the input (and adjust/error if it won’t work)” as well as the tactile
              part
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Try it out! You’ll need a music box to try out the result, but you don’t need laser-cutter access. If you have one of the music box kits, it comes with a hole punch for making your own music, and you can print these SVGs and
            then punch them by hand.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This is a prototype!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Wanted easiest way to try out the two primary cocmponents:
              <ol type="1">
                <li>midi to hole coordinates (plus a bit of sanity-checking)</li>
                <li>hole coordinates to printable sheet</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What’s cool about it? - tactile! - play your music forwards/backwards/upside down/ upside down and backwards</p>
      <p>
        What was fun for me about it? - Reaction from folks, contributions of arrangements - Presentation response: cursed vanessa carlton etc - Very easily extensible: originally built Cuttle SVG generation for one box, when i ordered
        another machine it was v easy to update existing code to support both boxes (feels good about initial implementation)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Next steps (no promises):
          <ul>
            <li>Pull both steps together in single end-to-end site</li>
            <li>Better pull in warnings about physical limitations and crank speed</li>
            <li>Take in [foo] as input (would be v cool!)</li>
            <li>Hacky MIDI processing on my end could be replaced nicely with midi-to-csv, lol</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
