        Not all projects are winners! Here is a write-up of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/hannahilea/BongoBoard">BongoBoard</a>, a project I’ve lost interest in completing.<a

            reassembled into a wireless Bluetooth keyboard, with the help of an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather">Adafruit Feather</a> microcontroller.
            It includes four buttons—the two built into each drum head—and a microphone. Each button—aka bongo thump—corresponds to a directional arrow key, but they can be remapped (in code) into more sophisticated keystroke outputs.

      <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Because it tickled my fancy: I find the concept of “drumming” input into a computer hilarious.</li>
        <li>
          Because I could. Thanks to having recently built a <a href="../slide-whistle-trombone-champ-controller/">slidewhistle-based Trombone Champ controller</a>, I knew that the physical construction was something I could now do
          relatively easily, and I wanted to practice those skills.

        <li>A stranger on eBay who wouldn’t cancel an order made at midnight.</li>
        <li>A friend with the elbow grease and determination to unscrew a bunch of proprietary screws without a proprietary screwdriver, who also offered advice towards attempting to salvage the onboard microphone.</li>
        <li>Some friends who helped brainstorm fun use cases for my BongoBoard not-yet-Adafruitified DK Bongos.</li>

        Even though these games <em>can</em> be played with the current BongoBoard, the drum-to-key mappings don’t really feel smooth or fun. A really solid implementation of a Tetris mode, for example, might use double-hand hits or claps
        to make a block fall fast.
      </p>
      <p>Some fun ideas for future BongoBoard applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Type messages? Drum messages!
          <em
            >Use ever-popular Morse code, or use the BongoBoard-specific B4, the latest in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9-inspired</a> predictive text

        </li>
        <li>Play <del>Drummy</del> Flappy Bird!</li>
        <li>Interact with a <a href="../ly-drawbot-setup/">pen plotter</a>!</li>
        <li>
          Perform beat poetry duets with a computer: trade drum phrases for bot-spoken phrases that have a complimentary rhythm (Credit: EP).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          BongoBoard was more fun to imagine than it was to see through to a satisfying-to-use result.
          <ul>
            <li>In the future, I may try to separate the “what would I do if I was going to do it?” stage from the “…and do I actually want to have done it?” stage more often.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it was pretty cool to say to myself “I want to build this thing” and then…be able to build it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          BongoBoard got me a lot of conversational mileage, which was a plus. One of my favorite parts of building silly things is getting to talk about building silly things with other people, who have lovely silly ideas of their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          One thing that I don’t love about this project is that the plastic body of the physical controller doesn’t feel particularly appealing, so I don’t really want the resultant BongoBoard sitting around as an
          <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_d%27art">objet d’art</a>. If it was a little nicer (wood? metal? etc) or was slightly smaller, or both, I would be more inclined to keep it
          around and spend a couple hours tuning at least one use-case to feel fun. (That said, the drum-button triggers are really nicely designed, and feel solid and nice to use. It’s really just the look of the drum body that isn’t my
          favorite.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I kind of want this thing out of my home? I have limited space, and it does not bring me joy. If you want to take it from its current state and turn it into something truly delightful, drop me a line and we can figure out a
        transfer.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> If I know you irl I’ll even throw in complimentary consultation if you want it.

              Welllllll almost! In the process of writing the “potential usage” section I got a bit excited again, and considered at the very least porting over my <a href="../telegraph-key-singular-board/">Morse keyboard code</a> into the
              BongoBoard. I had to remind myself that this project has been sitting in abeyance for nearly a year for a reason, and that reason is “even though it <em>would</em> be cool, there are other things I’d rather be doing with my
              time.” Now that this post is published, I can move the BongoBoard out of my mental “projects in progress” queue and move on. Phew.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              For the uninitiated, DK Bongos are a video game controller built by Nintendo for a series of Donkey Kong rhythm games—games where you drum your way through the jungle, for example. Or so I have been led to believe—I have never
              actually played a game on DK Bongos, as video games were not a part of my youth.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              What is an electret microphone? Great question! You won’t regret reading this comprehensive Open Music Labs write-up for the answer:

            <p>I think this one would be especially cool and creative—albeit time-consuming!—to implement. But it would be extremely fun.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
          </li>
          <li id="fn6">
            <p>Perhaps you have a use-case that will be especially silly when drummed? Or one of the ideas I noted above tickles your fancy? Maybe you’ll want to paint it, or bedazzle it, or otherwise jazz it up?</p>
            <p>Or just use it in its analog form and do some drumming! Inspiration:</p>
