      <h1>An ode to houseplant programming 🪴</h1>
      <div class="date">3 Apr 2025</div>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center (RC)</a> peer <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rygoldstein.com">Ryan</a> recently coined a phrase that I
instantly fell in love with: <em>houseplant programming</em>.</p>
<p>In Ryan’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The tool I built] solves my idiosyncratic problems and may not
address yours at all. That’s fine—take it as an ad to write tiny
software just for yourself. Houseplant programming 🪴<sup>[2]</sup> !
<br><br> <sup>[2]</sup> This isn’t an existing phrase as far as I know,
but the closest I can think of is “barefoot developers” which a) is a
little more granola than my vibe and b) is maybe tied up in some AI
stuff. I guess this is <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gwern.net/doc/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html">situated
software</a> but even smaller: I’m not building for dozens of users, I’m
building for one user in particular.<br> <span class="source"><a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rygoldstein.com/posts/introducing-mirror-darkly">[source]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Houseplant programming: tiny software just for yourself.
<em>Perfection.</em></p>
<p>At the risk of overexplaining and thus cheapening the analogy, I feel
the need to wax poetic.🪴</p>

<p>Before we get to the self-reflective bit, here is a non-exhaustive
list of parallels between houseplants and houseplant programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A happy home</strong>: I love having both plants and
homemade projects in my living space. Sharing a space with them reminds
me of things that I like about the world and myself. Exhibit A: Some of
my houseplants. Exhibit B: One of my houseplant programming
installations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Longevity</strong>: Like my plants, I love my little
projects and I want them to thrive, and I baby them a little bit to get
them started. But also, if they don’t work out? It isn’t a big deal,
into <del>the great compost bin in the sky</del> Github they go, where a
hard-won line or two may be <del>composted</del> recycled into a future
project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giftability</strong>: It is delightful to
<del>cultivate</del> program something for someone else, taking into
account their <del>light</del> wifi configuration and willingness to
<del>water regularly</del> debug future problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pet toxicity</strong>: Just like some plants, some
projects are practically poisonous to my cat and—if the cat had her
way—should be rehomed with a pet-free pal.</p>
<div class="centered-children">

</div></li>
<li><p><strong>Propagation</strong>: Clippings! I love to propagate my
plants and share them with friends. Do you want a pilea or a spider
plant or a nice philodendron? Let me know, I’ll hook you up! Do you want
to set up <a href="../ly-drawbot-setup/">your own pen plotter</a> or
make some quick and easy <a href="../meme-making/">screenshot memes</a>?
Awesome, I’ve written up my instructions and will do my best to set you
up for success when you run/build/program your own self.</p>
<p>And also, once that plant/code has taken up residence in your home,
it is no longer my responsibility. I’d love to hear about what you did
to help it thrive, and if it starts looking sad I’ll gladly help you
think through what might help, but if it never thrives I’m probably not
going to lose sleep over it.</p>
<p>Besides, once you’ve gotten as far as propogating the code/plant I’ve
given you? You know about as much about the situation as I do—maybe
more!—and now we can learn about the next steps together. Collaboration
is one of my favorite aspects of both gardening and
programming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universalization</strong>: I don’t necessarily care to
engineer my houseplants to grow in every environment—and similarly, I
don’t feel a need to make my houseplant code fully generalizable! While
I would love to know what you did to make a propogated plant flourish in
your home, and if those are changes I could apply , I’ll happily do
so—but I am not necessarily going to do that work on my own, absent some
larger goal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong>: I love reading about other
people’s houseplant projects. Do I want to take code cuttings for my own
home? Occasionally! But mostly I just want to wander around and admire
them, and hear about the woes encountered when figuring out how to help
the code/plants thrive. I do not need to propogate someone’s houseplant
in my own home order to admire it, or just to learn from them that maybe
I should consider a different watering scheme or fertilizer for my own
existing plants. Same goes for their houseplant code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capitalism</strong>: One person’s houseplants are another
person’s plant nursery. One person’s houseplant code is another person’s
B2B SAAS product. Enough said.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bugs</strong>: Soil gnats. Where do they even come from?!
It is unknowable. Similarly, smetimes my weather station shows me the
icon for snow, even though it is currently April and the temperature
isn’t predicted to dip below 32. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <a href="#fn1"

<p>TODO-image-snowflake</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-it-works-on-my-machine-is-the-goal-not-the-excuse">When “It
works on my machine” is the goal, not the excuse</h2>
<p>Things I have found myself saying about my projects, almost
apologetically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works for me, but…</li>
<li>It’s held together with <a
href="../slide-whistle-trombone-champ-controller/">string and electrical
tape and visibly disorganized wires</a>…</li>
<li>I have to do <a
href="../clapping-music-for-flip-disc-displays/">manual restarts after
the power goes off</a>…</li>
</ul>
<p>In the world of houseplant programming<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
none of these statements are apology-worthy. In a workplace, about a
project that is intended for productionization and mass dissemination?
Sure, production-ready code—code that does a job, or provides the
infrastructure for a job—needs to be some flavor of robust and tested
and reliable. For a project that lives in my house and does what I need
it to and periodically needs a little extra help? No biggie.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.evalapply.org/">Aditya Athalye</a> (another RC
peer!) perfectly captures this vibe in the project description for his
software project <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite?tab=readme-ov-file"><code>shite</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>shite</code>’s job is to help me make my website: <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://evalapply.org">https://evalapply.org</a>. Thus,
<code>shite</code>’s scope, (mis)feature set, polish will always be
production-grade, where production is “works on my machine(s)” :) <span

</blockquote>
<p>Strong “Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I
have won an award” energy:</p>

</figure>
<p>Any code is production ready, if you redefine the scope of your
production environment!</p>
<h2 id="not-an-idea-not-yet-a-platonic-ideal">Not an idea, not yet a
Platonic ideal</h2>
<p>While I build software as a career, I also like to muck about with
code in service of other goals. When sharing those other projects, it
has taken me a long time be able to talk about what my code does do
without adding a zillion caveats about what the code <em>does not</em>
do.</p>
<p>Why? I think somewhere along the line I picked up the unhealthy—and
false!—assumption that it wasn’t worth sharing my code unless it was
ready to be reused easily by whoever was able to access it—specifically,
not sharing that code until it was “production ready,” for some
arbitrary and ever-growing version of “production” that I never
<em>quite</em> fully defined for myself.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The <del>silliest</del> most insidious part of this
polished-or-nothing approach is that I’ve never felt it towards other
people’s projects or code, only my own. I’ve loved hearing and reading
about other people’s ideas and attempts, regardless of whether the
things they build could be reproduced or even if they resulted in any
concrete output at all.</p>
<p>I’ve been actively working against this personal bias for several
years now. One thing that I’ve found really helps me is having clear,
predefined terminology for my current phases of activity. Even if I then
have to define those term for someone who isn’t yet familiar with them,
merely having the terms in the first place provides an emotional safety
net.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> And thus, in the last year or so
when presenting personal projects I’ve taken to saying that they’re
prototypes.</p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of the personal projects I’ve built are
<em>not</em> prototypes, even if they share a lot of the same
characteristics of a prototype: they are a first-ish pass at bringing an
idea to life, they <em>could</em> be turned into a more generalizable or
generic Thing, they probably involve some context-specific configuration
or defaults, and they’re sometimes held together <a
href="../slide-whistle-trombone-champ-controller/">with string and
gluetack</a>.</p>
<p>While rebranding some of the projects I’ve built as “prototypes” has
helped me feel better about sharing something not totally polished or
fully documented with the world, I’ve also felt like the term somehow
devalues what I’ve built. Sure, sometimes what I’ve built <em>is</em> a
prototype! But sometimes, it’s just a <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/make-little-guys-112268885">weird
little guy</a> of an idea, and doesn’t need to be any more than what it
already is. Just existing is enough,and I’m not necessarily interested
in developing it into a less-weird less-little guy!</p>
<p>Thus: houseplant programming. Tiny software for just myself.</p>
<h2 id="bouquet-programming">Bouquet programming 💐</h2>
<p>I’m going to spare us all a further brainstorm of plant/code
parallels, with the exception of one spin-off term: bouquet programming
💐.</p>
<p>I’m hereby defining bouquet programming as one-off code that is
written for one specific user <em>to support one specific use-case</em>,
in a non-recurring way. By definition, it needs no maintainance and is
purely provided as documented proof of what once was living. Examples of
bouquet programming: an analysis script in support of a one-time plot, a
scrappy proof-of-concept or a <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example">minimal
reproducible example</a> written in service of a one-off use-case,
etc.</p>
<p>Bouquet programming is still worth writing home about (!) and sharing
generously in the same ways as houseplant programming—or agricultural
programming!—but is even <em>less</em> likely to work out-of-the-box
than houseplant code, even if rerun by the same person who originally
programmed it.</p>
<p>Examples of my own bouquet code: a script I used to scrape book cover
images for generating miniature book covers, code run in service of
helping a friend <a href="../video-timelapses-with-ffmpeg/">prepare
timelapse videos of her marbling process</a>, etc.</p>
<p>While building bouquet projects, I still try to program with an eye
towards future reproduction or generalization, while attempting to
follow the <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You
Ain’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI)</a> principle as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="footnotes-title">Footnotes</h3>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Okay, this one’s not inherently specific to houseplant
code! But the things I’m willing to do for my houseplants are different
than the things I’d do for plants I was entrusted with professionally.
Similarly, I am perfectly happy hacking together a janky working
pipeline, waiting to see what breaks, and manually restarting a system
that goes down. On a job? Nope, there’d probably be monitoring and tests
and nice documentation for whoever needed to know how to provide care in
my absence.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Should it be “houseplant programming” or “houseplant
programming 🪴”? Unless Ryan weighs in definitively, I’ll keep using the
two interchangeably.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>If this is something you resonate with, I encourage you
to look up “perfectionism” and some techniques for remedying it. Ditto
“capitalism”. 🙃<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>It may seem trite, but rebranding really has done
wonders for my happiness—and therefore continued momentum—as a
programmer. It feels bad to be monologing about a confusing situation,
but <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="TODO">rubber ducking</a>? Great! I’m not necessarily
thrilled to be slogging through cleaning up documentation, but I’m
pretty happy to have <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="TODO">increased the bus factor</a>!<a
