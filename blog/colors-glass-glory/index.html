      <p>
        At the beginning of the summer I came into some treasure, artistically speaking: a friend of a friend was clearing out vast quantities of material samples from her architecture studio, and invited her community to come and salvage
        what they wanted from her <del>piles of treasures</del> discard pile. Tile, flooring, wall treatments, wood, shingles—each with an array of colors and treatments. Imagine a garage sale, made up of only the type of object you are
        most interested in, and where everything is free. It was <em>magnificent</em>.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./assets/treasure.png" alt="“Pile of material samples to be sorted through”" />
      </figure>
      <p>I was relatively restrained in my choices, mostly due to the knowledge that my apartment does not have a lot of storage space. Anything I selected needed to either</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>be relatively small in footprint,</li>
        <li>be something I could imagine actively using soon and as-is, without first acquiring equipment, tools, or skill sets, or</li>
        <li>be too glorious not to leave behind.</li>
      </ol>
      <figure>
        <img src="./assets/samples2.png" alt="Photo of table with various material samples" />
      </figure>
      <p>After pouring through her offerings and actively talking myself out of many, many cool materials that I did not have the space to deal with—physically, emotionally, or spiritually!—I ended up choosing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A box of assorted linoleum tile samples (criteria A and C);</li>
        <li>A couple of cabinet door samples (B);</li>
        <li>Half a dozen keyrings of large-size paint color swatches, the grown-up version of the paint chips they have at the hardware store (C! C C C C C); and</li>
        <li>A cardboard box full of various glass tiles in assorted colors, most still <del>trapped in</del> adhered to their cardboard binder books (B and C! But mostly C. Definitely not A. Very C.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As soon as I got home I got to work detaching the tiles from their binders.</p>

      <p>
        My original plan was to turn all of the tile into mosaics, and to attempt to do so relatively soon, before the creativity adrenaline wore off.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In the
        process of freeing the glass tiles from their <del>mortal coils</del> sample books, I encountered one particular set of glass tile samples that were so fun to rearrange and reorder that I couldn’t possibly imagine cementing them
        into a single “final” mosaic arrangement. Instead, I wanted to be able to continue to play with them.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Inspired by a set of multicolor fridge magnets my mom got me during college that are still on my fridge, I bought a bunch of magnetic backing tape and some allegedly weatherproof adhesive and turned the tiles into magnets…</p>

        <img src="./assets/magnet-process.png" alt="Photo of magnet assembly process: glue, books for weights, magnet strips" />
      </figure>
      <p>…which I then stuck onto my apartment’s steel porch railing. Bam, art installation!</p>
      <p><img style="max-width: 100%" alt="Photo of rainbow tile pattern along a brown metal railing" src="./assets/tada.png" /></p>
      <p>They look <em>so</em> good, have fascinating interactions with light at different times of day, and make me happy whenever I see them out the window. Also, they are fun to play with.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite patterns thus far was made by Alex’s dad, using the greens and blues; I liked his pattern so much that I replicated it in the remaining warm colors.</p>
      <p><img style="max-width: 100%" alt="Photo of wavey mosaic pattern" src="./assets/nothing.png" /></p>
      <p>I’m excited to see how the next porch visitor chooses to rearrange them!</p>
      <h2 id="project-2-gladomosaik">Project 2: GLADOMOSAIK</h2>
      <p>
        Alex showed me <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ikea-mosaic-table-hack-37362124">a bunch of folks mosaic-ing</a> onto Ikea’s

        tiles? I sure did!
      </p>
      <p>
        After it arrived, I pulled out the remaining portion of my salvaged glass. The outer rim was the easiest part—I arranged the remaining colored glass tiles into the table as I pulled them out of their storage box, sorting as I went.
        They looked great, no changes needed. Ship it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Figuring out the inside fill took considerably more time. I made a bunch of different variations—possibly more iteration than on any art project I’ve ever done before?—until finally settling on the one I was happy to make
        permanent.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>

      <p>I glued it all down. A few days later—after the adhesive cured—it was grout time:</p>

      <p>Then, after the grout cured, paint:</p>

      </div>
      <p>That’s it! Well, modulo applying a clear grout sealer that I have yet to acquire…</p>

      <p>
        This was a perfect summer project, and I am exceedingly pleased with how it turned out. This is my first-ever outdoor mosaic; it remains to be seen if I made effective adhesive, grout, and grout sealer choices. Check back after the
        winter!

      <p>
        I had an idea for making a bunch of mobiles and/or bunting out of the paint color swatches, which conveniently would let me make use of a super chonky circular hole punch I picked up the other day.<a
          href="#fn3"
          class="footnote-ref"

          ><sup>3</sup></a
        >
        I got to punching!
      </p>
      <p>It took…a while. Luckily, it went fairly quickly and was a good activity to do while listening to a book.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I thought that once the holes were punched out, the remainder of the paint strips could be recycled. Joke’s on me, it turns out they look really really cool themselves. What I do with them is yet to be determined, but “just recycle
        them” is no longer a viable option.

      <p>
        What now? Nothing pressing, as I’ve now used up enough of my haul that the remainder isn’t taking up a significant amount of space in my home! The remaining tiles fit into my pre-existing mosaic materials box, the linoleum squares
        have taken up residence with my linocut materials, and…okay, well, I need to move on to the next step with those punched holes AND with their remaining hole-less strips, which actually do take up a Certain Amount™ of space. But
        still! I’d say I did a pretty successful job of only acquiring materials that I could put to use fairly immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, nothing pressing from <em>this</em> set of materials. 😅 A couple weekends ago we took a trip to

              I find mosaics straightforward to do at home: they require relatively few materials, most of which I already own, and aren’t particularly messy. More importantly, I have proven to myself that mosaics are a type of art I will
              actively create, rather than think about for years and never actually do! Looking at you, pile of years-old stained glass materials still waiting for their opportune moment…<a

              If you prefer a different one than I did, don’t tell me. :D I will say, some of them look a lot better in the photos than they did in real life; it’s harder to see from the photos, but the respective heights of the various
              tiles played a key role in how happy I was with a given pattern.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
