<p>At the beginning of the summer I came into some treasure,
artistically speaking: a friend of a friend was clearing out vast
quantities of material samples from her architecture studio, and invited
her community to come and salvage what they wanted from her <del>piles
of treasures</del> discard pile. Tile, flooring, wall treatments, wood,
shingles—each with an array of colors and treatments. Imagine a garage
sale, made up of only the type of object you are most interested in, and
where everything is free. It was <em>magnificent</em>.</p>
<figure>

alt="“Pile of material samples to be sorted through”" />


</figure>
<p>I was relatively restrained in my choices, mostly due to the
knowledge that my apartment does not have a lot of storage space.
Anything I selected needed to either</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>be relatively small in footprint,</li>
<li>be something I could imagine actively using soon and as-is, without
first acquiring equipment, tools, or skill sets, or</li>
<li>be too glorious not to leave behind.</li>
</ol>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>After pouring through her offerings and actively talking myself out
of many, many cool materials that I did not have the space to deal
with—physically, emotionally, or spiritually!—I ended up choosing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A box of assorted linoleum tile samples (criteria A and C);</li>
<li>A couple of cabinet door samples (B);</li>
<li>Half a dozen keyrings of large-size paint color swatches, the
grown-up version of the paint chips they have at the hardware store (C!
C C C C C); and</li>
<li>A cardboard box full of various glass tiles in assorted colors, most
still <del>trapped in</del> adhered to their cardboard binder books (B
and C! But mostly C. Definitely not A. Very C.).</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as I got home I got to work detaching the tiles from their
binders.</p>

<h2 id="project-1-magnetic-mosaics">Project 1: Magnetic mosaics</h2>
<p>My original plan was to turn all of the tile into mosaics, and to
attempt to do so relatively soon, before the creativity adrenaline wore
off.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In the process of freeing the glass
tiles from their <del>mortal coils</del> sample books, I encountered one
particular set of glass tile samples that were so fun to rearrange and
reorder that I couldn’t possibly imagine cementing them into a single
“final” mosaic arrangement. Instead, I wanted to be able to continue to
play with them.</p>

</figure>
<p>Inspired by a set of multicolor fridge magnets my mom got me during
college that are still on my fridge, I bought a bunch of magnetic
backing tape and some allegedly weatherproof adhesive and turned the
tiles into magnets…</p>
<figure>

alt="Photo of magnet assembly process: glue, books for weights, magnet strips" />


</figure>
<p>…which I then stuck onto my apartment’s steel porch railing. Bam, art
installation!</p>
<p><img style="max-width:100%" alt="Photo of rainbow tile pattern along a brown metal railing" src="./assets/tada.png"></img></p>
<p>They look <em>so</em> good, have fascinating interactions with light
at different times of day, and make me happy whenever I see them out the
window. Also, they are fun to play with.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" alt="Photo of rainbow mosaic railing at night" src="./assets/nightlight.jpeg"></img></p>
<p>One of my favorite patterns thus far was made by Alex’s dad, using
the greens and blues; I liked his pattern so much that I replicated it
in the remaining warm colors.</p>
<p><img style="max-width:100%" alt="Photo of wavey mosaic pattern" src="./assets/nothing.png"></img></p>
<p>I’m excited to see how the next porch visitor chooses to rearrange
them!</p>
<h2 id="project-2-gladomosaik">Project 2: GLADOMOSAIK</h2>
<p>Alex showed me <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ikea-mosaic-table-hack-37362124">a
bunch of folks mosaic-ing</a> onto Ikea’s <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/gladom-tray-table-black-50411990/">GLADOM
tray table</a>; did I want her to order me a GLADOM for my new tiles? I
sure did!</p>
<p>After it arrived, I pulled out the remaining portion of my salvaged
glass. The outer rim was the easiest part—I arranged the remaining
colored glass tiles into the table as I pulled them out of their storage
box, sorting as I went. They looked great, no changes needed. Ship
it!</p>
<p>Figuring out the inside fill took considerably more time. I made a
bunch of different variations—possibly more iteration than on any art
project I’ve ever done before?—until finally settling on the one I was
happy to make permanent.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<p>I glued it all down. A few days later—after the adhesive cured—it was
grout time:</p>

<p>That’s it! Well, modulo applying a clear grout sealer that I have yet
to acquire…</p>

</figure>
<p>This was a perfect summer project, and I am exceedingly pleased with
how it turned out. This is my first-ever outdoor mosaic; it remains to
be seen if I made effective adhesive, grout, and grout sealer choices.
Check back after the winter!</p>

<h2 id="project-3-have-giant-hole-punch-will-travel">Project 3: Have
giant hole punch, will travel</h2>
<p>I had an idea for making a bunch of mobiles and/or bunting out of the
paint color swatches, which conveniently would let me make use of a
super chonky circular hole punch I picked up the other day.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I got to punching!</p>
<p>It took…a while. Luckily, it went fairly quickly and was a good
activity to do while listening to a book.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="column2">
<p><img src="./assets/chips4.png" alt="Photo of ring of paint swatches" style="width:100%"></p>
</div>
<div class="column2">
<p><img src="./assets/chips2.png" alt="Photo of bins holding circular punched holes" style="width:100%"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I thought that once the holes were punched out, the remainder of the
paint strips could be recycled. Joke’s on me, it turns out they look
really really cool themselves. What I do with them is yet to be
determined, but “just recycle them” is no longer a viable option.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="column2">
<p><img src="./assets/chips3.png" alt="Photo of remainder of paint swatches, after circles were cut out" style="width:100%"></p>
</div>
<div class="column2">
<p><img src="./assets/chips5.png" alt="More post-punching scraps" style="width:100%"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<h2 id="next-up">Next up?</h2>
<p>What now? Nothing pressing, as I’ve now used up enough of my haul
that the remainder isn’t taking up a significant amount of space in my
home! The remaining tiles fit into my pre-existing mosaic materials box,
the linoleum squares have taken up residence with my linocut materials,
and…okay, well, I need to move on to the next step with those punched
holes AND with their remaining hole-less strips, which actually do take
up a Certain Amount™ of space. But still! I’d say I did a pretty
successful job of only acquiring materials that I could put to use
fairly immediately.</p>
<p>Well, nothing pressing from <em>this</em> set of materials. 😅 A
couple weekends ago we took a trip to <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.mit.edu/w1mx/www/swapfest/swapfest-2025.08.pdf">Swapfest,
aka The Flea at MIT</a>, and now I’m back to square one with the whole
“pile of awesome objects to be turned into creative projects”
situation…</p>

<p>Stay tuned, I guess!</p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you thank you thank you to CL for all the colorful
materials, which were the creative spark I needed to jump-start my
summer!</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>I find mosaics straightforward to do at home: they
require relatively few materials, most of which I already own, and
aren’t particularly messy. More importantly, I have proven to myself
that mosaics are a type of art I will actively create, rather than think
about for years and never actually do! Looking at you, pile of years-old
stained glass materials still waiting for their opportune moment…<a
href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>If you prefer a different one than I did, don’t tell me.
:D I will say, some of them look a lot better in the photos than they
did in real life; it’s harder to see from the photos, but the respective
heights of the various tiles played a key role in how happy I was with a
given pattern.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
