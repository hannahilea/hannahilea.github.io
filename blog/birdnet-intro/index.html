        It’s summer here in the greater Boston area, and a little too hot, and my bird neighbors are <em>yelling</em>, as they have been since early spring. Yours too? Sounds like the perfect time for any good
        <del>birb creeper</del> citizen scientist to set up a <del>spy ring for snooping on birbs</del> passive acoustic monitoring station!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/">BirdNET model</a> trained and released by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi">BirdNET-Pi</a> application built on top of it by an open-source community, it is easier than ever to become the bird voyeur you were born
        to be. For example, here’s what I measured on May 6, from the microphone just outside my window in a semi-urban neighborhood:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./assets/may6.png" alt="Screenshot of bird detection bar chart from May 6" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        We can see that the House Sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) chorp from dawn to dusk, [5am-6pm); that a Blue Jay (<em>Cyanocitta cristata</em>) shows up around 4pm and just does <em>not</em> stop hollering for about an hour; and
        that our American Robin (<em>Turdus migratorius</em>) friends make a brief stopover shortly after 5am.
      </p>
      <p>In contrast, a month before—on April 6—there was a much larger American Robin and Blue Jay presence, while the sparrows had not yet come into their own (read: set up their nests in the trees nearby):</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./assets/april6.png" alt="Screenshot of bird detection bar chart from April 6" />
      </figure>
      <p>A month after—on June 6—the sparrows persist, but their babies had fledged, so the jay was back to asserting its auditory dominance:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./assets/june6.png" alt="Screenshot of bird detection bar chart from June 6" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Over the last several months I have been fairly consistently <del>chorping</del> talking with folks about this installation, which is how I know that a bunch of other people would love to set up BirdNET-Pis of their own, for
        themselves or others.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end, I have written up my setup instructions for you, person who wants to set up your own bird listening station as quickly and cheaply as possible! To make set-up as straight-forward as possible, I detailed
        <em>exactly</em> what I did to set mine up, in a borderline-too-verbose way. I assume no prerequisite computer knowledge beyond a basic “uses a computer as part of daily living” starting point. I look forward to hearing about the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/when-bird-birb-extremely-important-guide">birb</a> friends yelling around <em>your</em> homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this post provides some background and motivation for the decisions I made in my set-up, including cost, [lack of] robustness, and privacy concerns. The set-up instructions themselves can be found
        <a href="../birdnet-setup/">here</a>.

      <h2 id="brief-background-and-motivation">Brief background and motivation</h2>
      <p>While I’ve been aware of the excellent ecoacoustics work coming out of the Cornell Ornithology Lab for years now, I only encountered the BirdNET project about a year ago.</p>
      During the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>’s 2024 <em>Never Graduate Week</em>,
      <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://subject.space/">Logan Williams</a> presented on
      <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://subject.space/projects-static/winter-bird-cycles/"><em>Bird signs and cycles, February, 2024</em></a
      >, a beautiful and compelling interactive visualization he created from recordings captured by his own BirdNET-Pi installation.

          <span class="source"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://subject.space/projects-static/winter-bird-cycles">[source]</a></span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>I was sold!</p>
      <p>
        I set up my first BirdNET-Pi installation as a gift for my dad,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which necessitated testing it out my own window. When I packed it up to send it off,
        I acutely missed spying on my new sparrow friends.
      </p>
      <p>A bit later in the year, my parents requested a second installation, so that they could monitor birds on the other side of the yard(!). I decided to set one up for my home at the same time. All three are currently in use!</p>
      <h2 id="terminology-birdnet-vs-birdnet-pi">Terminology: BirdNET vs BirdNET-Pi</h2>
      <p>Let’s take a pause to clarify some terminology that I found confusing when I got started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/">BirdNET</a></strong> is the name of a machine learning model trained to identify the presence of specific bird calls in short segments of
            audio. It was trained by the Ornithology Lab.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model can be used in a variety of different applications, including the phone app <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/">BirdNET Sound ID App</a>. The model is made available via
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer">BirdNET-Analyzer</a>, and licensed under a
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</a>, which means that you
            can only use it for non-commercial purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the BirdNET model is similar to—but not the same as—the model that powers the also-excellent
            <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin Bird ID</a></strong> birdsong identification phone app. While Merlin is also built from the Cornell Ornithology Lab(!), as I
            understand it the models are trained on different data, and do not necessarily use the same ML architecture. Similar overall goal, different model, different name!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi">BirdNET-Pi</a>)</strong>
            is the name of a specific application built to run the
            <code>BirdNET</code> model on a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> computer. It was initially developed by GitHub user
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi"><code>mcguirepr89</code></a> and is now maintained by
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi"><code>Nachtzuster</code></a
            >, along with support from the open-source community of programmers. My set-up uses the Nachtzuster fork.[^distinction]
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [^distinction] This is an important distinction if you’re reading the repository’s documentation or looking up help elsewhere on the internet! The links tend to bounce between the <code>mcguirepr89</code> and
        <code>Nachtzuster</code> repos without warning, and it is very easy to spend time in a debugging hole while inadvertently reading docs or code for the opposite fork. Be ye warned!
      </p>
      <pre><code>In general, if you talk about BirdNET out in the world, you will need to specify that you mean *BirdNET-Pi* or folks may think you&#39;re talking about BirdNET phone application.

There are other applications built on top of the BirdNET model, including others for Raspberry Pi. BirdNET-Pi is one of the longer-running, well-documented, and currently maintained projects, so it is what I chose.</code></pre>

            basic Raspberry Pi flagship series, the Pi Zero, the Pi Pico, etc.

            Pi, folks often reasonably assume it is running on an Arduino. At the end of the day, both a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino are tiny bundles of computing power that can be programmed to perform tasks.

      <h2 id="birdnet-pi-installation-requirements">BirdNET-Pi installation requirements</h2>
      <p>My custom BirdNET-Pi setup is a <a href="../houseplant-programming/">houseplant programming 🪴</a> project with the following initial requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Accomplish “microphone out window, listen to birds” as directly as possible, without consideration towards future weatherproofing or battery-powered installations.</p></li>
        <li><p>Relatively cheap to make, i.e., should run on the cheapest viable Raspberry Pi model—the Zero (~$15), rather than the flagship series ($35-$80+)—and with a cheap microphone.</p></li>
        <li><p>Be as privacy-conscious as possible for an always-on microphone, i.e., make use of configuration choices that mitigate privacy concerns.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Result in an installation that can trivially be gifted to someone else who has an interest in birds and doesn’t necessarily need or want to learn the ins and outs of this specific monitoring system.<a
              href="#fn2"
              class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref2"
              role="doc-noteref"
              ><sup>2</sup></a
            >
          </p>
          <p>More specifically, after the initial set-up by me, the installation will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Connect to a giftee’s Wi-Fi network out of the box, without my presence during installation;</p></li>
            <li><p>Just Work™ whenever plugged into a power source and in range of the configured Wi-Fi network;</p></li>
            <li><p>Be relatively easy to debug remotely, so that a gifted unit can plausibly be debuggable without my traveling to the installation site.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a meta level, I had an additional requirement that I document everything well enough that the set-up would be easy to trivially rerun for additional installations.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
      <p>Loads of other people have cool write-ups about their own setups, specific to their own requirements, and if your use-case differs from mine I encourage you to seek those out—or create (and write up) your own!</p>
      <p>
        Oh, and a disclaimer: why haven’t I converted this whole shebang—well, everything after the hardware setup—into a single script that can Just™ be run directly, or opened a pull request against the original BirdNET-Pi repo to modify
        the existing setup script to that effect? Time, mostly. It’s on my list as a follow-up task; in the meantime, the instructions are useable as-is.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-does-the-birdnet-pi-applicationdo">What does the BirdNET-Pi application…do?</h2>
      <p>
        The BirdNET-Pi application has two components: a classification pipeline that constantly analyzes recorded audio for bird sounds, and a small web server that hosts a website that visualizes those detections. The website also lets
        users configure the application’s various settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does the classification pipeline work? - The microphone is always on, and a continuous series of <code>x</code>-length recordings are captured, where <code>x</code> is 15 seconds by default. - Each recording is first converted
        into a spectrogram—a picture of the sounds over time—and that spectrogram is fed into the BirdNet model. - The BirdNet model outputs the probabilities that the spectrogram contains various sounds produced by a various bird species
        and by humans (e.g., speech). - If there are human sounds detected with a probability above a certain customizable threshold, the recording is thrown out for privacy reasons. - If there are no human sounds detected and there
        <em>are</em> bird sounds detected, the recording is saved, the spectrogram is saved, and an entry with that detection is added to a database on the Pi. - When new data is added to the database, the day’s summary graph is
        regenerated.<br />
        …that’s it!
      </p>
      <p>The website then pulls data from that database to display the most recent detections, the recordings and spectrograms of those detections, and the daily summary graphs.</p>
      <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        I am generally a privacy and spyware-conscious person, and my background is in audio signal analysis; I do not have (and do not ever plan to have) any of the always-listening “assistants” running in my spaces. And yet, I willingly
        built and deployed this always-listening device and installed it in my home! What gives?
      </p>
      <p>Here are the considerations I made, which you should probably consider before installing one around your home:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>This is an always on microphone! Running in your home! Make sure that <em>everyone in your home</em> is on board with that</strong>, and agrees on where to install it (i.e., where the microphone will be located).
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you have visitors who will be anywhere near where your microphone is, <strong>make sure that those guests know about it also</strong>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless your Wi-Fi network is configured to allow inbound access, <strong>there is no connection between the outside web and your birdnet-pi device</strong> This means that the only people who have access to the recordings made on
          the device are people who you’ve given both the password to your Wi-Fi network and the password to the Raspberry Pi. Once able to access both those systems, a user will have access to both the realtime audio being recorded onto
          the device and the audio stored because it has a detected birdcall in it; no recordings are stored for audio that has no bird detection in it OR that does have a bird detection but additionally has a human sound detection in it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              BirdNET-Pi supports the option to publish detections (audio and classifications both, I think?) to the outside web, but enabling it requires extra effort on your part; it is not something you might accidentally enable it. I
              have not enabled this feature for myself yet.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where possible, I’ve made application configuration settings that <strong>prioritize disabling services that can inadvertently be creepy</strong>. My installation is in an area inhabited and frequented by humans, so I default
          disabled the “live listening” function, and I bump up the privacy threshold that excludes audio for having human detections in it, to err on the side of not having any talking end up in the saved audio recordings that contain bird
          detections.
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is possible for vocalizations with human voice in the background to sneak through, despite this threshold setting. You will know that this is happening if you listen back to recorded bird detections and hear human voice in
              the background at all! If you notice it happening, go into your settings and increase the threshold by a notch. (The current as-set-above value has been sufficient for my installation, which is in a well-populated neighborhood
              with constant foot traffic and me-talking-on-the-porch noise, but definitely don’t assume all recordings are free from human speech without validating that first.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In sum, If you trust the people who have access to your Wi-Fi network, and disclose the presence of the microphone to anyone who would otherwise have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a space, you’re good to go.<a

      <p>
        You will be unsurprised to learn that I have a lot of follow-up ideas about potential next steps, ways to investigate and tune the installation settings for a specific site, ways to make the installation more robust, and privacy
        considerations. In the interest of getting these instructions published ASAP, I’m going to save those thoughts—plus output interpretation—for a future post. Suffice it to say, they exist!

        you, let me know. I’d love to help!

              Okay, I’ll admit it: I am <strong>super</strong> self-conscious about having spent the time documenting some kinda silly steps (like “run this, wait until it fails, then do X”) instead of spending that time making a single
              clean installation script that doesn’t require so much manual mucking about. HOWEVER. As I keep reminding myself, these are the steps I followed, figuring out parts of it was annoying time-consuming, and the goal here is
              sharing the “how I reproduce my own workflow” steps that <em>I</em> follow when setting up a new BirdNet-Pi. The work to update things upstream is important, but it is a secondary, orthogonal task to sharing what I currently
              have working. So I tell myself. :) Houseplant programming!<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              If you don’t trust the people who have access to a Wi-Fi network, do not configure your BirdNET-Pi to connect to it!! Have it connect to your phone hotspot or something. Or, don’t install a BirdNET-Pi there at all.<a
