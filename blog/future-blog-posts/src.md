# Titles of blog posts I might never write

...but maybe I will! 

My tech writing these days follows DDD (Dopamine-Driven Development), which means that if you tell me what you want to read from me, I will be that much more likely to write it.

Without further ado, some things I could write *right now*:

### Project write-ups[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) and tutorials
- *Musidex* | What I wanted was a Craigslist jukebox; what I got was a Rolodex. (Closing line: *I still want a Craigslist jukebox.*)
- *Obsessed with <a class="impersonal" href="https://cuttle.xyz/">Cuttle</a>: Parametric CAD for prototyping, producing, and procrastinating*
- *Making mixtapes for your youngest pals* | Do you want to enable the song addictions of the small children in your life, to set them on a path towards music obsession, while despite potentially annoying the heck out of their parents? Of course you do! (This post is not sponsored by <a class="impersonal" href="https://us.yotoplay.com/collections/library">Yoto</a>, but could be, should they choose... 👀)
- *Small Tales* | On building a bookshelf of your favorite reads, in miniature, for when you have limited bookshelf space or a limited book budget.
- *Mobiles! For that new tiny human in your extended universe*
- *Easy inter-room trolling: OSX's `say`, a bluetooth speaker, and you*
- *Quick and easy meme-making, for fun and no profit[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)*
- *How do I a creative coding?*[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)
- *Mix of the Month Clubs for the 2020s* | Mixtapes are my love language, but no one has a cd player anymore (not to mention a disc drive, or a cassette player). What's a fellow to do?
- *Message in a bottle, or, the US Postal Service is way more fun than most people know it is*
- *Stabby McStabface: The joy of needlefelting memes*
- *From LiveJournal to [tinylogger](www.tinylogger.com) and beyond: My current writing workflow*
- *How should I know when there's a new blog to read?* | What the heck is RSS, and how do I make it work for me if I don't consider myself tech saavy?
- *The rest of the owl: My first experience with <a class="impersonal" href="codecrafters.io">codecrafters</a>*

### Feelings™ (tech and otherwise)
- *Spite-driven development (SDD) and other DDs*
- *A batch at the Recurse Center: My antidote to burnout*
- *The Mike Ratio: A Bechdel test for the modern tech team*
- *Towards a Bechdel test for assessing a candidate employer*[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) 
- *The Hannahspeak cheatsheet* | The what/why/wherefore/emojis of the phrases I parrot, and why you might want to use them too
- *The "just" flag flies true*
- *"Leaving on good terms" is a bidirectional process with a long tail*
- *The 1-1 IC template for my future self (that I wish I'd been using all along)*
- *Niceties™: From third grade to the Recurse Center, and beyond*

Right. Now that I've gotten the current list out of my head, maybe I'll be able to pick one and just go for it....

### Footnotes
<anchor id="footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></anchor>Also, this list only includes a few of the as-yet-undocumented [projects](https://www.hannahilea.com/projects) from my backlog, but anything on that page is fair game for a DDD request.

<anchor id="footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></anchor>These already exist in slide form from my batch at RC, so :just: need to be edited appropriately.

<anchor id="footnote-3"><sup>3</sup></anchor>Why yes, the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) does play an oversized role in my consciousness, why do you ask? As does [Bechdel herself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel) and [the musical incarnation of her memoir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qlagsg5LT8).
