<p>The goal of these instructions is to make it trivially easy to get a
new BirdNET-Pi installation up and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
The instructions are intentionally verbose, written for folks who use
computers but don‚Äôt consider themselves programmers, and anyone who has
never worked with a Raspberry Pi before. If you fit this description but
find that the instructions fall short, please let me know!</p>
<h2 id="one-time-setup">One-time setup</h2>
<p>Here are the tasks we‚Äôll be stepping through:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: Acquire components</li>
<li>1: Initial Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W set up</li>
<li>2: SSH time‚Äîtalk to the Pi</li>
<li>3: BirdNET-Pi application installation</li>
<li>4: Configure the BirdNET-Pi application</li>
<li>Optional:
<ul>
<li>5: Install Tailscale for remote monitoring</li>
<li>6: Support additional Wi-Fi networks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>7: Physical installation</li>
</ul>
<p>While it may look like there‚Äôs a lot here, it is a straight-forward
‚Äúa lot,‚Äù without implicit steps that require leaving this page. Don‚Äôt be
nervous‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this!</p>
<p>Also: I ran this setup from my personal computer, which happens to be
a Mac. If you‚Äôre on a Windows machine the screenshots might not exactly
match what you see, but the steps are the same.</p>

the plug or get an adapter for it.</li>
<li>You could alternatively use a rechargable power brick instead of a

</ul></li>
<li>Access to <strong>an SD card writer</strong>, in dongle form [ <a

<ul>
<li>The step that requires an SD card writer is relatively brief and
first on the list, so you could easily get away with borrowing a
friend‚Äôs, rather than buying your own‚Äîespecially if you set up a
BirdNET-Pi for them while you‚Äôre at it!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Total cost: ~$60, not including the SD card
writer</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="task-1-initial-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-set-up">Task 1: Initial
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W set up</h3>
<p>In this step, we‚Äôll install an operating system (OS) on the Raspberry
Pi Zero 2 W, by loading it onto the microSD card.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plug the SD card writer into your computer, and put the microSD
card into it. (The microSD card almost certainly came with an adapter
that allows it to fit into the SD card writer slot.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/photo-sdcard.png" alt="Photo of SD card in writer" />

</figure></li>
<li><p>Install the Raspberry Pi Imager application on your computer, by
selecting the correct ‚ÄúDownload for Windows/macOS‚Äù option on this page:
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi
Imager</a></p></li>
<li><p>Open the Raspberry Pi Imager application, and make the following
selections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Device: <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong></li>
<li>Operating System: <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 64-bit)
LITE</strong>
<ul>
<li>This option may be nested in the ‚ÄúRaspberry Pi OS (other)‚Äù folder
and require a little bit of searching.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Storage: <strong>Generic - SD/MicroSD Media</strong>, which is the
microSD card that‚Äôs currently in the writer</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-1.png"
alt="Screenshot of selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text" />


</figure>
<p>‚Ä¶<strong><code>NEXT</code></strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to optionally ‚ÄúApply OS customization
settings?‚Äù, for which you should select
<strong><code>EDIT SETTINGS</code></strong>. On this page, set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostname:
<strong><code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></strong>,
<ul>
<li>This will be the name of the Raspberry Pi, e.g.,
<code>birdnet-foo</code>, <code>birdnet-backyard</code>,
<code>birdnet-007</code>, whatever! The identifier I chose in these
screenshots is <code>hannex</code>, such that my full hostname is
<code>birdnet-hannex</code>.</li>
<li>Make it something unique enough that if you set up multiple
birdnets, you‚Äôll be able to keep them separate. I typically use the
initials of the recipient.</li>
<li><em>Note that the angle brackets (‚Äú&lt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù) here and elsewhere
in this tutorial should not be included in your chosen
<code>&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code>; they are simply convention used to
indicate the user-specific parts of variables.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Username and password:
<strong><code>&lt;pi_username&gt;</code></strong> /
<strong><code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>This will be the username and password for the Raspberry Pi. I use
<code>birbwatcher</code> as the username for all of mine, so that‚Äôs what
you‚Äôll see in my screenshots. Make sure to write these values down
somewhere, as you‚Äôll need them whenever you want to log into your
Pi!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configure wireless LAN:
<strong><code>&lt;your_current_wifi_network_name&gt;</code></strong> /
<strong><code>&lt;your_current_wifi_network_password&gt;</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>Important: this must be the Wi-Fi network name (‚ÄúSSID‚Äù) and password
for the Wi-Fi network your computer is <em>currently using</em>, and
that you‚Äôll be using for the rest of the Pi setup. If you‚Äôre setting
this device up for someone else, there‚Äôll be a separate step to
additionally add <em>their</em> Wi-Fi network info later; for now, this
should be yours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure the time zone is correct for wherever your birdnet will be
installed.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-2.png"
alt="Screenshot of selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<ul>
<li>Under the <em><code>SERVICES</code></em> tab, confirm that
<code>enable SSH</code> and <code>use password authentication</code> are
both selected‚Äîthey likely already are, by default.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-3.png"
alt="Screenshot of additional selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<p>‚Ä¶<strong><code>SAVE</code></strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>You‚Äôll be reprompted to ‚ÄúApply OS customization settings?‚Äù; now
select <code>YES</code>. You might get a scary looking message asking
you to confirm that any existing data on the card will be overwritten;
select <code>YES</code> to continue. If prompted for a password, use the
password for the computer you‚Äôre running the configuration from‚Äînot any
of the passwords we‚Äôve set for the Pi.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-4.png"
alt="Screenshot of additional selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Imager will now proceed to write the operating
system and configuration settings to your microSD card! It may take a
few minutes, but the progress bar will tell you when its done, and the
microSD card will be automatically disconnected from your computer
(‚Äúejected‚Äù) once the writing is complete. At this point it is safe to
remove the card from the reader!</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the microSD card from the writer and put it into the
microSD card slot in the Raspberry Pi 2 Zero W:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/sd.png" alt="Photo of MicroSD card in Pi 2 Zero W" />


</figure></li>
<li><p>Connect the power cable to one of the Pi‚Äôs micro USB ports, and
plug its other end into the wall. Once powered, the Pi will turn on
automatically; you‚Äôll be able to tell, because a green light will start
flashing on the Pi. This may take a few moments!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Pi will use the Wi-Fi credentials you set earlier to
automatically connect to your wireless network. We can (and will!) do
the rest of the setup wirelessly!</p>
<h3 id="task-2-ssh-timetalk-to-the-pi">Task 2: SSH time‚Äîtalk to the
Pi</h3>
<p>This step is barely worthy of its own section, but giving it a header
should make it easier for you to find again when you inevitably forget
how to connect. :D</p>
<p>By choosing the ‚ÄúLite‚Äù operating system in the previous task, we
configured the Pi to run ‚Äúheadless‚Äù‚Äîwhich means without a dedicated
monitor, keyboard, or mouse. To interact with it without those things,
we connect to it remotely over the wireless network, via a protocol
called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>.
<strong><em>As long as your personal computer is on the same Wi-Fi
network you configured the Pi to connect to</em></strong> and the Pi is
powered, you‚Äôll be able to SSH onto it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On your personal computer, open up your terminal application‚Äîif
you‚Äôre on a Mac, this is literally called ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù; on Windows it‚Äôs
called ‚ÄúWindows Terminal‚Äù‚Äîand type</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
<p>and then hit enter.</p>
<p>For example, to SSH onto the device in my screenshots above, I type
<code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex.local</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/ssh.png"
alt="Screenshot of ssh connection window." />


</figure></li>
<li><p>If prompted to continue connecting, type <code>yes</code> and hit
<code>enter</code>. (This will only happen the first time your computer
connects to the new Pi.)</p></li>
<li><p>When prompted for a password, type the
<code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> from above (without the angle
brackets!!) and hit <code>enter</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre on! Any commands you type into your terminal window
will now be run <em>on your Raspberry Pi</em>. üòÆ</p>
<p>Oh, and if you want to close the SSH connection? Type
<code>exit</code> and then hit <code>enter</code>, or just close the
terminal window.</p>
<p>In your terminal window, how can you tell which machine you‚Äôre
sending commands to? How can you tell if your SSH connection is running
or has dropped?</p>
<p>Look at the start of each line: when you‚Äôre on the Pi, the
‚Äúprompt‚Äù‚Äîthe default text at the start of the line in your terminal‚Äîwill
be <code>&lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code>. When
you‚Äôre on your personal machine, it will be something else, probably the
name of your computer unless you‚Äôve customized it to look different.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/ssh2.png"
alt="Screenshot demonstrating opening and closing an SSH connection." />


</figure>
<p>In the screenshot, my local prompt is the path to my working
directory ‚Äú~‚Äù in a blue arrow, and the prompt on the Pi is the white
<code>birdnet-hannex</code>. (The text styling may look different for
yours, but the concept is the same.)</p>
<p>If your SSH connection drops at any time‚Äîyour internet chokes, you
decide it‚Äôs bedtime and want to finish another day, you accidentally
close your terminal window‚Äîsimply SSH back on again.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-birdnet-pi-application-installation">Task 3: BirdNET-Pi
application installation</h3>
<p>Okay. You‚Äôve set up the Pi, you‚Äôve ssh‚Äôd onto the Pi‚Äîit‚Äôs time to add
the ‚ÄúBirdNET‚Äù part of BirdNET-Pi!</p>
<p>In this step, we‚Äôll download and run the installer for the BirdNET-Pi
application, and then change some of the Pi‚Äôs configuration for storage
limits, restart behavior, and logging. Some of the following is going to
seem a little silly, but it works. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Bear with me!</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre prompted for a password at any point, use the
<code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> you set previously. When a step says
‚Äúrun‚Äù, that means to type or copy the given text into the terminal and
then hit <code>enter</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In your remote terminal‚Äîthat is, the one where you‚Äôve SSH‚Äôd onto
your Pi‚Äîrun <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code></p>
<p>This will open up a new file (which will be saved to
<code>/etc/rc.local</code>) in a program called nano, which is a text
editor that runs in the terminal. Copy and paste the following into it:
<code>#!/bin/sh -e  iw wlan0 set power_save off  exit 0</code> Select
<code>ctrl</code> and <code>x</code> at the same time to close the file,
then <code>Y</code> followed by <code>enter</code> to save this content
to the new file. After the file saves you‚Äôll be returned back to your
command prompt.</p>
<p>Want to confirm that you write and saved the correct content to this
file? Run <code>cat /etc/rc.local</code> to print the contents of that
<code>/etc/rc.local</code> file in the terminal. If the content matches
the above text, you‚Äôre good to go‚Äîif it doesn‚Äôt, simply try again: do
<code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> to reopen the file in your editor,
and edit it so that it matches!</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo chmod u+x /etc/rc.local</code> in the terminal.
This makes the new file you just created executable, i.e., allows the
computer to run it.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the swap space limits! Run
<code>sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile</code> to open the file
<code>/etc/dphys-swapfile</code> in nano. Then press the down/up arrow
keys to find and update the lines that contain
<code>CONF_SWAPSIZE</code> and <code>CONF_MAXSWAP</code>. For each line,
edit it to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Delete the <code>#</code> from the start of the line, if present,
and</li>
<li>Update their values to be <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048</code> and
<code>CONF_MAXSWAP=4096</code>, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what part of that file should look like, after you‚Äôve edited
it:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/screenshot-swapfile.png"
alt="Screenshot of text file with the above settings set." />


</figure>
<p><em>A <code>#</code> at the start of the line means that the line is
commented out‚Äîwhich means that the changes on that line will be ignored.
We do not want them to be ignored, so we delete that
<code>#</code>!</em></p>
<p>Once more, hit <code>ctrl</code> and <code>x</code> together,
followed by <code>Y</code>, followed by <code>enter</code>, to save
these changes; once more, you‚Äôll be returned to the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>In the terminal, run <code>sudo reboot</code>. This will cause
the Pi to‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîreboot, which will automatically close your ssh
connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for a moment or two for the Pi to reboot, then SSH back onto
it:</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
<p>(But you knew that already by now, right? :) )</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, this is the bit that is going to feel silly. Just go with
it. In your remote terminal, run</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
<p>A bunch of text will print out to the screen, but you don‚Äôt have to
pay attention. Eventually, it WILL eventually fail, with a ‚ÄúNo space
left on device‚Äù error. That‚Äôs expected! You want it to happen!</p></li>
<li><p>After you‚Äôve gotten the error, run the following at the
prompt:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -o remount,size=5G /tmp/
rm -rf BirdNET-Pi/
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
<p>‚Ä¶when it eventually succeeds (eventually! This step is slow, lots of
things happen during installation) the Pi will reboot.</p></li>
<li><p>‚Ä¶SSH back onto it again! I bet you remember the command this
time.</p>
<p><em>You can also probably use the up-arrows in your terminal to page
back through the previous command history in your terminal, which at
this point definitely contains your SSH command! You can hit
<code>enter</code> on any item in the command history to rerun
it.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf</code> which will
dump you into yet another file in your text editor!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Replace <code>#SystemMaxUse=</code> with
<code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and then</p></li>
<li><p>Save the file ( <code>ctrl+x</code> , <code>Y</code>,
<code>enter</code>!).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Run <code>systemctl restart systemd-journald</code>. This will
prompt you to enter your password <code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> when
prompted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you‚Äôve installed the BirdNET-Pi application!
Congrats!</p>
<h3 id="task-4-configure-the-birdnet-pi-application">Task 4: Configure
the BirdNET-Pi application</h3>
<p>The BirdNET-Pi application consists of two components: a
classification pipeline that constantly analyzes recorded audio for bird
sounds, and a small web server that hosts a website to visualize those
detections. The website also lets users configure the application‚Äôs
various settings. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be doing in this task!</p>
<p>For the following steps, use whatever browser on your computer you
prefer: Chrome, Firefox, whatever.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In your browser of choice, go to the website <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://birdnet-hannex.local/"><code>http://birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local/](http://birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local/). (For my installation, that's [</code>http://birdnet-hannex.local/</a>).
Note that this site will <em>only work</em> if you are visiting it from
a machine on the same Wi-Fi network that your Pi is currently connected
to!</p>
<p>You should see something like this, only with no detections yet:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/landing.png"
alt="Screenshot of BirdNET-Pi website, with list of species detections." />


</figure></li>
<li><p>Select the <code>Tools</code> tab. When prompted for a username
and password, type <code>birdnet</code> and leave the password
empty.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the default username and password of the BirdNET-Pi
<em>application</em>, which we have not yet set! If you want to change
it, you can do that on the settings page; I haven‚Äôt bothered to change
mine because I trust anyone who I‚Äôve granted access to my Wi-Fi network
not to mess with my BirdNET-Pi settings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In <code>Tools &gt; Services</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong><code>Disable</code> the
<code>Live Audio Stream</code></strong>. This is optional‚Äîyou
<em>could</em> leave it enabled. I disable mine for two reasons:
<ol type="1">
<li>I don‚Äôt want the ability to hear the recorded audio stream live, so
it is a waste of compute power to leave it on, potentially slowing
everything else down; and</li>
<li>It makes it too easy to accidentally is a potential privacy
violation, as the live audio hasn‚Äôt been analyzed yet so doesn‚Äôt
bypass/throw out any human sounds.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong><code>Disable</code> the
<code>Streamlit Statistics</code></strong>. This service the Species
Stats tab, which is unusably slow on the Raspberry Pi Zero. Might as
well turn it off, since we can‚Äôt use it!</li>
</ol>
<p>For both these services, be sure to select <code>Disable</code>
instead of <code>Stop</code>; the former will persist after reboot, the
latter will only halt the service until reboot.</p>
<p>Note that it may take a few seconds to a minute for these settings to
update after being clicked; your Pi is working very hard to analyze
birds and handle website requests at the same time! Have
patience.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>Tools &gt; Settings</code>, update latitude and
longitude to that of your planned installation location, then select
<code>Update settings</code>.</p>
<p>How do you find that info? In Google Maps, right click on a location
to see its latitude and longitude:</p>
<figure>

<li><p>In <code>Settings &gt; Advanced Settings</code>, set:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy threshold to 1%</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Recording Length to 30</strong> then select
<code>Update settings</code>.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>When ssh‚Äôd onto the Pi, you can do <code>sudo tailscale down</code>
to disconnect from the VPN, or <code>sudo tailscale up</code> to
reconnect. (<code>tailscale status</code> tells you whether you are
currently connected or not.)</p>
<p>If you are giving the Pi to someone else, and only want it to be
available to your Tailscale network when that giftee specifically
enables it‚Äîand they are willing and able to interact with a terminal
themselves!‚Äîyou can <code>sudo tailscale down</code> for now, and then
give them instructions to SSH on and do a <code>sudo tailscale up</code>
when needed.</p>

<h3 id="task-6-optional-support-additional-wi-fi-networks">Task 6
(Optional): Support additional Wi-Fi networks</h3>
<p>There may be multiple Wi-Fi networks to which you want the Pi to
auto-connect when in range. For example, when I set up a birdnet for
someone else, I want it to autojoin my home network‚Äîfor quality checking
before I send it off!‚Äîas well as the network of the home I‚Äôm sending it
to. Perhaps you want to allow your Pi to connect to your phone‚Äôs
hotspot, so that you can take it with you on various outdoor
adventures?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<p>For each additional network you want to add, paste the following:</p>

    wifi-sec.psk &quot;&lt;NETWORK-PASSWORD&gt;&quot;</code></pre>

<h3 id="task-7-physical-installation">Task 7: Physical installation</h3>
<p>Time to stick that microphone out a window!</p>
<p>While you <em>could</em> just unplug your Pi, it‚Äôs safer for the Pi
(less chance of something going wrong!) to intentionally power it down
first. While SSH‚Äôd onto the Pi, do TODO</p>
<p>And then plug the Pi into whatever outlet is accessible to the Pi
stuck out the window! Be mindful of whether anything will get wet if it
rains (bad!), especially if that thing is the Pi (very very bad! do not
do this). As an example, here is what my installation looks like:</p>
<div class="centered-children">
<figure>
<img src="../birdnet-intro/assets/installation.png" alt="Photo of Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W taped to a wall"/>
<figcaption style="font-size:smaller">
My exceptionally professional looking setup. Note the piece of white
tape for sticking the Pi to the wall, and the piece of black tape, for
covering up the Pi‚Äôs bright green light, which otherwise is annoyingly
bright at night.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="centered-children">
<figure>
<img src="../birdnet-intro/assets/mic.png" alt="Photo of microphone in dirty windowsill"/>
<figcaption style="font-size:smaller">
A view of the microphone, and also of my exceedingly dirty inner window
frame. I was so horrified by this photo that I considered cleaning it
out and taking a new photo. As you can see, I did not do that. Also, I
just slide the window shut over top of the wire; the window isn‚Äôt so
snug that it is a problem. We did a similarly half-assed installation
out of my parents‚Äô window, which was also sufficient for bird detection!
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Once powered, the analysis service and web server will start right
away, and it will autoconnect to the Wi-Fi network that you configured
it for, which means that you will be able to see what it‚Äôs doing via
<code>foo.local</code> on another device (phone, laptop) as long as that
device is on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>Once your BirdNET-Pi is up and running, anyone connected to your home
Wi-Fi network can view the latest birds at
<code>birdnet-foo.local</code>. Anyone connected to your tailscale
network can see the same via <code>birdnet-foo.TODO</code>.</p>
<p>Click around to explore what‚Äôs visible to you; note that the TODO and
TODO tabs won‚Äôt show anything, since we disabled those services (above).
Until you‚Äôve detected a few birds, the app will seem pretty boring and
janky, but leave the microphone plugged in for a bit and then recheck
it! The page may be a bit slow to load‚Äîremember that this site is being
served entirely from that little Raspberry Pi Zero you just set up, and
in addition to making the website you‚Äôre trying to view, it is also
constantly recording and analyzing sound. It‚Äôs doing the best it
can.</p>
<h2 id="daily-usage">Daily usage</h2>
<p>To view the website being broadcast by your Pi,
http://birdnet-foo.local. To access this site, you‚Äôll need to be on the
same Wi-Fi network that your Pi is connected to.</p>
<p>If you did the optional Tailscale installation, you can additionally
view your site at http://birdnet-foo.<TODO>.ts.net/.</p>
<p>Optional niceties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a sign in your home with a link to the site, to show visitors
how to connect to your Wi-Fi and then view your birds</li>
<li>If you have an old display of some sort, you can set up a
semi-permanent viewing station. My parents mounted an old iPad near the
window with the BirdNET installation, and set its default landing page
to view birdnet detections.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"

<h3 id="system-administration-details">System administration
details</h3>
<p>Your BirdNET-Pi is now running! Awesome! Congrats! Uh‚Ä¶what if
something goes wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>If your power goes out, or your Wi-Fi router resets, the Pi will
automatically reconnect and start back up.</li>
<li>If your Pi is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi for whatever reason,
BirdNET will continue to run its detection and analysis; you just won‚Äôt
be able to connect to it (i.e., see the website for your installation)
until the Pi has connected to the Wi-Fi again.</li>
<li>If your internet is out but your Wi-Fi router is still running,
you‚Äôll still be able to see your Pi‚Äôs website</li>
<li>If you are unable to load your Pi‚Äôs website from another device,
check the following (in roughly this order):
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the Pi plugged into power? Is the green light on it flashing (to
indicate that it is powered)?</li>
<li>Is the Pi able to access the wireless network it was configured to
run on? i.e., is that network accessible and can you connect to it with
another device (i.e., your phone, a laptop, etc)?</li>
<li>(If you aren‚Äôt running tailscale) Is the device you‚Äôre trying to
view the website from connected to the <em>same network as the device
is</em>? This is the gotcha question‚Ä¶if they aren‚Äôt on the same network,
the website won‚Äôt be viewable. (This means if your phone is on the 5g
home network and your Pi is on the regular network, you won‚Äôt be able to
view the website.)</li>
<li>(If you are running tailscale) Does the device you‚Äôre trying to view
the website from have tailscale enabled? Are you loading the site
through its tailscale address (TODO) rather than FOO.local (TODO)?</li>
<li>Can you connect to the Pi via ssh? If the Pi is powered and
connected to the Wi-Fi,</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you set the device up for someone else and it turns out you set
up their Wi-Fi password incorrectly, use your phone to create a hotspot
with the same credentials of the Wi-Fi network you were on when you
first set up the Pi (i.e., your home network, if you set this up for
someone else) to get onto the Pi.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Once the Pi begins to run out of storage space, which won‚Äôt happen
for a long time,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> the oldest recordings will be
deleted to make space for newer recordings.
<ul>
<li>You can preempt this ‚Äúloss‚Äù by periodically moving older recordings
off the device to a different storage location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We have now left the happy harbor of this basic installation document
so if you‚Äôre hitting issues here, search around in some of the resource
docs below, or message me or something‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>Data backup:
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs probably a good idea to copy your database off the Pi
periodically. I don‚Äôt do this, but I should, because if the SD card dies
there‚Äôs no way to recover your data. TODO-instructions</li>
<li>Also more minimal instructions sans recordings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If you use these instructions‚Äîor are otherwise inspired to set up a
BirdNET-Pi of your own‚Äîplease let me know! If anything is unclear or
broken, <strong>please tell me</strong>. If you know me in real life and
want assistance or company while you run through a set up, or just want
me to just set one up for you, let me know. I‚Äôd love to help!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Fun fact, SD card choice <em>really</em> matters if
