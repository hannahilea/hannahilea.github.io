        The goal of these instructions is to make it trivially easy to get a new BirdNET-Pi installation up and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The instructions are intentionally verbose, written for folks who use computers but don‚Äôt
        necessarily consider themselves programmers, as well as for anyone who has never worked with a Raspberry Pi before. If you fit this description but find that the instructions fall short, please let me know! Also, I hope you have fun
        with it.

          <p>and then on the following page, set:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hostname: <strong><code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></strong

              <ul>
                <li>
                  This will be the name of the Raspberry Pi, e.g., <code>birdnet-foo</code>, <code>birdnet-backyard</code>, <code>birdnet-007</code>, whatever! The identifier I chose in these screenshots is <code>hannex</code>, such that my
                  full hostname is <code>birdnet-hannex</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Make it something unique enough that if you set up multiple birdnets, you‚Äôll be able to keep them separate. I typically use the initials of the recipient.</li>
                <li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  This will be the username and password for the Raspberry Pi. I use <code>birbwatcher</code> as the username for all of mine, so that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see in my screenshots. Make sure to write these values down somewhere, as
                  you‚Äôll need them whenever you want to log into your Pi!
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              <strong><code>&lt;your_current_wifi_network_password&gt;</code></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Important note 1: This must be the Wi-Fi network name (‚ÄúSSID‚Äù) and password for the Wi-Fi network your computer is <em>currently using</em>, and that you‚Äôll be using for the rest of the Pi setup. If you‚Äôre setting this
                  device up for someone else, there‚Äôll be a separate step to additionally add <em>their</em> Wi-Fi network info later; for now, this should be yours.
                </li>
                <li>Important note 2: If you have a 5 GHz option network (e.g., <code>MyFunWifiNetwork</code> and <code>MyFunWifiNetwork_5G</code>, do NOT use the 5G one! At time of writing, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W‚Äôs do not support it.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the time zone is correct for wherever your BirdNET-Pi will be installed.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Under the <em><code>SERVICES</code></em> tab, confirm that <code>enable SSH</code> and <code>use password authentication</code> are both selected‚Äîthey likely already are, by default.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¶select <strong><code>SAVE</code></strong
            >!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You‚Äôll be reprompted to ‚ÄúApply OS customization settings?‚Äù This time select <code>YES</code>. You might get a scary-looking message asking you to confirm that any existing data on the card will be overwritten; select
            <code>YES</code> to continue. If prompted for a password, use the password for the computer you‚Äôre running the configuration from‚Äînot any of the passwords we‚Äôve now set for the Pi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raspberry Pi Imager will now proceed to write the operating system and configuration settings to your microSD card! It may take a few minutes, but the progress bar will tell you when its done, and the microSD card will be
            automatically disconnected from your computer (‚Äúejected‚Äù) once the writing is complete. At that point it will be safe to remove the card from the writer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Remove the microSD card from the writer and put it into the microSD card slot in the Raspberry Pi 2 Zero W.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Connect the power cable to one of the Pi‚Äôs micro USB ports, and plug its other end into the wall. Once powered, the Pi will turn on automatically; you‚Äôll know the Pi is on because a green light will start flashing on the Pi.
            This may take a few moments.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        Congratulations, you‚Äôve now installed the operating system on your Pi! When the Pi boots up, it will automatically use the Wi-Fi credentials you provided to connect to your wireless network. We can‚Äîand will!‚Äîdo the rest of the setup
        wirelessly.
      </p>
      <h3 id="task-2-ssh-timetalk-to-the-pi">Task 2: SSH time‚Äîtalk to the Pi</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, we‚Äôll ‚ÄúSSH onto the Pi‚Äù, i.e., send commands to it from another computer. It is barely worthy of its own section in this tutorial, but giving it one should make it easier to find again when your future self inevitably
        forgets the single command. :D
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we do this? In the previous task we chose the ‚ÄúLite‚Äù operating system for our Pi, which means we configured the Pi to run in ‚Äúheadless‚Äù mode‚Äîi.e., without a dedicated monitor, keyboard, or mouse. To interact with the Pi in
        the absence of those peripherals, we connect to it remotely over a wireless network, using a communication protocol called the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your Pi is powered on, <strong>as long as your personal computer is on the same Wi-Fi network you configured the Pi to connect to</strong>, you‚Äôll be able to SSH onto it from your personal computer. (I‚Äôve put that bit in bold
        because it is mission critical!)
      </p>

      <p>Okay. You‚Äôve set up the Pi, you‚Äôve ssh‚Äôd onto the Pi‚Äîit‚Äôs time to add the ‚ÄúBirdNET‚Äù part of BirdNET-Pi!</p>
      <p>
        In this task, we‚Äôll download and run the installer for the BirdNET-Pi application and then change some of the Pi‚Äôs configuration for storage limits, restart behavior, and logging. Some of the following is going to seem a little
        silly, but it works. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Bear with me!

          <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
          <p>This will create a new file at path <code>/etc/rc.local</code> and open it in a program called <strong>nano</strong>, which is a text editor that runs in the terminal.</p>
          <p>Using your arrow keys and keyboard as with a regular text editor, Edit the file so its contents are exactly as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>#!/bin/sh -e
iw wlan0 set power_save off
exit 0</code></pre>
          <p>To do this you can either type these contents in manually, or copy and paste the contents using <code>ctrl+c</code>/<code>ctrl+v</code> commands, as with any other text editor.</p>
          <p>
            To exit this file, press <code>ctrl</code> and <code>x</code> at the same time; then <code>y</code> to save the modifications, then <code>enter</code> to select the path you originally opened as the save path. You will then be
            returned back to your command prompt.

              <pre><code>cat /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
              <p>
                to display the file contents in the terminal. If the displayed content matches the text above, you‚Äôre good to go‚Äîif it doesn‚Äôt, simply do <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> to reopen the file in your editor and try again!

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To make the file you just created executable, i.e., to enable the computer to run it, run</p>
          <pre><code>sudo chmod u+x /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
          <p>in the terminal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To update the Pi‚Äôs swap space limits, run</p>
          <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile</code></pre>
          <p>to open the file <code>/etc/dphys-swapfile</code> in nano.</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>Use the down arrow to scroll through the file to the line that says <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=512</code> and edit it to be <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048</code></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the terminal, run <code>sudo reboot</code>. This will cause the Pi to‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîreboot, which will automatically close your SSH connection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Wait for a moment or two for the Pi to reboot, then SSH back onto it:</p>
          <pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>

        <li>
          <p>Okay, this is the bit that is going to feel silly. Just go with it. In your remote terminal, start the BirdNET-Pi installation script by running</p>
          <pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
          <p>
            A bunch of text will print out to the screen, as various files and dependencies are copied onto the Pi. You don‚Äôt have to pay attention to that text‚Äîyou just have to wait and wait, <em>until the installation fails</em>. This may
            take a long time, on the order of tens of minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            That‚Äôs right: eventually, <strong>the installation script you just ran will fail(!)</strong> with a ‚ÄúNo space left on device‚Äù error. That‚Äôs expected! You want it to happen!<a

        <li>
          <p>Now re-run the installation step, first deleting the failed installation directory:</p>
          <pre><code>rm -rf BirdNET-Pi/
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
          <p>This step is slow, as lots of things happen during installation. Be patient!</p>
          <p>This time the installation script should succeed. You‚Äôll know it has succeeded because the Pi will reboot, which will close your SSH connection.</p>
          <p>
            If it does NOT succeed, i.e., you still get a failure message when you run that <code>curl</code> command, repeat the commands in this step. Try this a couple times before giving up and emailing me that my instructions did not

      <p>Congrats! You‚Äôve now installed the BirdNET-Pi application! üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ The finicky part is over.</p>
      <h3 id="task-4-configure-the-birdnet-pi-application">Task 4: Configure the BirdNET-Pi application</h3>
      <p>
        The BirdNET-Pi application consists of two components: a classification pipeline that constantly analyzes recorded audio for bird sounds, and a small web server that hosts a website that visualizes those detections. The website also
        lets users (you!) configure the application‚Äôs various settings. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be doing in this task.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the following steps, use whatever browser on your computer you prefer‚ÄîChrome, Firefox, whatever. Note that the BirdNET-Pi website will be slow to load and respond, which is to be expected: remember that it is being run
        <em>on your Raspberry Pi</em>! Have patience, and don‚Äôt click around excessively in frustration if things are moving more slowly than you‚Äôd like‚Äîthat‚Äôll just make things worse.
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p>In your browser of choice, go to the website</p>
          <pre><code>http://birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local/</code></pre>
          <p>For my installation, that‚Äôs <code>http://birdnet-hannex.local/</code>.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>This URL will only succeed (i.e.¬†the page will load) if you are visiting it from a machine on the same Wi-Fi network that your Pi is currently connected to!</em></p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Select the <code>Tools</code> tab. (You may need to make your browser window wider or click the button with the horizontal black lines to make the toolbar visible.) When prompted for a username and password, use
            <code>birdnet</code> as the username and leave the password empty.

            <li>
              These are the default credentials of the BirdNET-Pi <em>application</em>, as defined in the installation script we just ran, rather than any of the credentials we configured previously for the Pi itself. If you want to change
              this default, you can do that on the Settings page. (I haven‚Äôt bothered to change mine yet, because I trust the folks who have access to my Wi-Fi network to not mess with my BirdNET-Pi settings.)

                Click <strong><code>Disable</code></strong> in <strong><code>Live Audio Stream</code></strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>This step optional‚Äîyou <em>could</em> leave it enabled. I disable mine for two reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I don‚Äôt want the ability to hear the recorded audio stream live, so it is a waste of compute power to leave it on and possibly slow everything else down; and</li>
                <li>This ‚Äúfeature‚Äù makes it too easy to accidentally wander into a privacy violation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Click <strong><code>Disable</code></strong> in <strong><code>Streamlit Statistics</code></strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p>This service powers the Species Stats tab, which involves making some additionally summary and analysis plots, but is unusably slow on the Raspberry Pi Zero. Might as well turn it off, since we can‚Äôt use it!</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>For both these services, be sure to select <code>Disable</code> instead of <code>Stop</code>; the former will persist after reboot, the latter will only halt the service until reboot.</p>
          <p>
            It may take a few seconds to a minute for each setting to update after you‚Äôve clicked its button; that‚Äôs to be expected! Your Pi is working very hard to analyze birds and handle website requests at the same time. Have patience!
            If you‚Äôre taken to a different screen with a black terminal on it, just go back to <code>Tools &gt; Services</code> to confirm that those services are now disabled. It should look like this once complete:

          <p>In <code>Tools &gt; Settings</code>, update latitude and longitude to that of your planned installation location, then select <code>Update settings</code>.</p>
          <p>You can use <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latlong.net/">this site</a> or in Google Maps, right click on a location to see its latitude and longitude:</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In <code>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced Settings</code>‚Äîfound at the bottom of the basic <code>Tools &gt; Settings</code> page‚Äîset:</p>

        If you‚Äôre gifting this BirdNET-Pi to someone else who wants you to act as tech support for their installation, or you want to be able to check on your own installation while you‚Äôre not connected to your home Wi-Fi network, you can
        add your Pi to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> network‚Äîbasically, it acts as a virtual private network for your various devices. This is an optional task!

          <li>

              Optional: If this is your first time using Tailscale, you‚Äôll need to additionally install it on whatever device you plan to use to access the BirdNET-Pi‚Äîe.g., I have it installed on both my personal computer and my phone.
              Steps for these different devices are available <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation">in their documentation</a>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Now, from any device on your Tailscale network, you can SSH onto your Pi through that network, and no longer need to be on the same wireless network! Try this by opening a new Terminal window and running</p>
            <pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Note the lack of <code>.local</code> at the end of the host name! E.g. over Tailscale I now do <code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex</code> instead of <code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex.local</code>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Similarly, you can view the Pi‚Äôs website via your Tailscale network, so that you no longer have to be on the same wireless network as the Pi! You‚Äôll still need to do this from a machine that is part of your Tailscale
              network‚Äîthis url won‚Äôt work from a machine that isn‚Äôt, i.e., you can‚Äôt just give the URL to a friend and expect it to work.
            </p>
            <p>Find the Pi‚Äôs URL in your Tailscale console. E.g., for my device, the console shows its address as</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./assets/ts-url.png" alt="Screenshot of console with address" />
            </figure>
            <p>so I access mine at <code>http://birdnet-hannex.feist-matrix.ts.net/</code>. If you go to that address, you will not be able to see anything‚Äîbecause you are not part of my Tailscale network.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That‚Äôs it!</p>
        <p>
          While SSH‚Äôd onto the Pi, you can do <code>sudo tailscale down</code> to disconnect it from the VPN, or <code>sudo tailscale up</code> to reconnect. (<code>tailscale status</code> will tell you whether you are currently connected
          or not.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are giving the Pi to someone else, and only want it to be available on your Tailscale network when they specifically enables it‚Äîand they are willing and able to interact with a terminal themselves!‚Äîyou can
          <code>sudo tailscale down</code> for now, and then give them instructions to SSH on and do a <code>sudo tailscale up</code> when needed.

      <p>
        Want to configure your Pi to connect to additional Wi-Fi networks? When I set up a BirdNET-Pi for someone else, I want it to recognize my home network during setup, and for quality checking before I send it off(!), but I also want
        it to auto-connect to the network of its recipient. Similarly, you could configure your Pi to connect to your phone‚Äôs hotspot, so that you can take it with you on various outdoor adventures.<a

      <p>Time to stick that microphone out a window!</p>
      <p>
        While you <em>could</em> just unplug your Pi, it‚Äôs safer for the Pi to intentionally power it down first‚Äîless chance of something going wrong!<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> While
        SSH‚Äôd onto the Pi, do <code>sudo shutdown</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now go find a window, and stick your microphone out it! You‚Äôll need to choose a window near a power outlet. Once the microphone is in the great outdoors‚Äîideally, somewhere where you‚Äôve heard at least one bird recently!‚Äîplug it into
        the second micro-USB port on the Pi. Plug the Pi into the outlet, and wait! In your choice of microphone location, be mindful of whether anything will get wet if it rains (bad!), especially if that thing is the Pi (very very bad! do
        not do this).
      </p>
      <p>Here are some photos of my own setup, for inspiration. You‚Äôll note that it is sophisticated and bespoke, perfectly tailored to its environs.</p>
      <div class="centered-children">

          <figcaption style="font-size: smaller">
            A view of the microphone, and also of my exceedingly dirty inner window frame. I was so horrified by this photo that I considered cleaning it out and taking a new photo. As you can see, I did not do that. Also, I just slide the
            window shut over top of the wire; the window isn‚Äôt so snug that it is a problem. We did a similarly half-assed installation out of my parents‚Äô window. Both have proven sufficient for bird detection!
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        Once powered, both the analysis service and web server will start right away, and the Pi will autoconnect to the Wi-Fi network for which you configured it. This means that you will be able to see the BirdNET-Pi website that your Pi
        is serving by going to the address <code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code> in a web browser on another device‚Äîphone, laptop‚Äîthat is connected to the same Wi-Fi network!
      </p>
      <p>Optional niceties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put up a sign in your home with a link to the site, to show visitors how to connect to your Wi-Fi and then view your birds</li>
        <li>
          If you have an old display of some sort, you can set up a semi-permanent viewing station. My parents mounted an old iPad near the window with their (first üòÖ) BirdNET installation, and set its default landing page to view their
          BirdNET-Pi detections.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>

      <p>You‚Äôre basically done; this task is merely an ‚Äúacquaint yourself with the web application‚Äù stretch goal!</p>
      <p>
        Click around your site‚Äî<code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code>‚Äîto explore what‚Äôs visible to you; note that the ‚ÄúLive Audio‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpecies Stats‚Äù links won‚Äôt show anything, since we disabled those services earlier. The page
        may be a bit slow to load‚Äîremember that this site is being served entirely from that little Raspberry Pi Zero you just set up, and in addition to making the website you‚Äôre trying to view, it is also constantly recording and
        analyzing sound. It‚Äôs doing the best it can.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>Until your Pi has detected a few birds, your website will seem pretty boring and sparse. But not for long! Leave the microphone plugged in for a bit and then recheck your site.</p>
      <p>
        Also, remember that once your BirdNET-Pi is up and running, anyone connected to your home Wi-Fi network (and <em>only</em> folks connected to your home Wi-Fi network) can view your latest birds at that same
        <code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code> URL!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you set up Tailscale, you‚Äôll be able to visit your site on any other device connected to your Tailscale network. To figure out the URL through which to do this, go to your Tailscale dashboard and copy the machine‚Äôs IP address
        into your browser. If you feel that a string of numbers isn‚Äôt quite pleasing enough for you, you can click the arrow next to the IP address to access a human-readable domain address, which will look something like
        <code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.&lt;random&gt;-&lt;words&gt;.ts.net</code>
        .

      <p>Your BirdNET-Pi is now running! Awesome! Congrats!</p>
      <p>Here is a list of things worth knowing, in no particular order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When powered, your Pi will automatically record audio and analyze it for bird calls.</li>
        <li>When powered, your Pi will automatically attempt to connect to its configured Wi-Fi network.</li>
        <li>
          If the BirdNET-Pi cannot connect to the Wi-Fi network (the network is not available for whatever reason), it will still record and analyze audio.
          <ul>
            <li>While you won‚Äôt be able to connect to it‚Äîi.e., see the website for your installation‚Äîuntil your Pi has Wi-Fi connectivity again, you won‚Äôt have missed any detections in the meantime.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The website run on BirdNET-Pi‚Äôs does not need Internet connectivity. If your Wi-Fi router is running, you‚Äôll be able to see your Pi‚Äôs website, regardless of whether your router is connected to the internet or not.</li>
        <li>
          Once the Pi begins to run out of storage space, which won‚Äôt happen for a long time,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the oldest recordings will be deleted to make space for newer
          recordings.
          <ul>
            <li>If you care about this, you can preempt this loss by periodically moving older recordings off the device to a different storage location.</li>
            <li>The database records of those recordings will not be deleted, just the recordings‚Äîso you may not care about preserving them, as you will still have a record of the detections and their times and species, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Uh‚Ä¶but what if something goes wrong?</p>
      <p>If you are ever unable to load your Pi‚Äôs website from another device, or SSH onto it, check the following (in roughly this order):</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Is the Pi plugged into power?</strong> If so, its green light will be flashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Is the Pi able to access the wireless network</strong> it was configured to run on? i.e., is that network accessible and can you connect to it with another device (i.e., your phone, a laptop, etc)?</li>
        <li>
          (If you <em>aren‚Äôt</em> running Tailscale) <strong>Is the device you‚Äôre trying to view the website from connected to the <em>same network as the BirdNET-Pi</em>?</strong> In my experience, this is the most common failure mode!
          <ul>
            <li>If you aren‚Äôt on the same network, the website won‚Äôt be viewable. Double-check that the viewing device isn‚Äôt inadvertently connected to the <code>_5G</code> variant of your Wi-Fi network.</li>
            <li>Also think about whether you configured your Pi to connect to multiple networks. If you did, are they both accessible to the Pi? If so, make sure you try both networks from your viewing device.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          (If you <em>are</em> running Tailscale) <strong>Does the device you‚Äôre trying to view the website from have Tailscale enabled</strong>, and is it part of the same network that the Pi was added to? Double-check that you‚Äôre
          attempting to connect to the application‚Äôs <code>.ts.net</code> URL rather than the <code>.local</code> URL.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Can you connect to the Pi via SSH?</strong> If the Pi is powered and connected to the Wi-Fi, this will be possible.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you set up a BirdNET-Pi for someone else, and discover once in their space that you set up their Wi-Fi password incorrectly (or forgot to set it up at all!), never fear! Update the name of your phone and the password of its
        hotspot to mirror that of the Wi-Fi network you first used to set up the Pi. Then, once you‚Äôve <del>tricked the Pi into connecting to your phone</del> connected to the Pi through your hotspot, update the Pi with the correct
        configuration for the new Wi-Fi network.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>

      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, one last thing: it‚Äôs probably a good idea to copy your database off the Pi periodically! I don‚Äôt do this yet, but I should, because if the SD card dies there‚Äôs no way to recover your data. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù button somewhere in
        the website, perhaps buried in the settings page, which will save everything (database, recordings) onto your local machine. If I end up doing something different than that in the future, I‚Äôll update here accordingly.
