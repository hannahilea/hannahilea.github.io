<p>The goal of these instructions is to make it trivially easy to get a
new BirdNET-Pi installation up and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
The instructions are intentionally verbose, written for folks who use
computers but don‚Äôt consider themselves programmers, and anyone who has
never worked with a Raspberry Pi before. If you fit this description but
find that the instructions fall short, please let me know!</p>

the plug or get an adapter for it.</li>
<li>You could alternatively use a rechargable power brick instead of a

</ul></li>
<li>Access to <strong>an SD card writer</strong> [ <a

<li>The step that requires an SD card writer is relatively brief and
first on the list, so you could easily get away with borrowing a
friend‚Äôs rather than buying your own‚Äîespecially if you set up a
BirdNET-Pi for them while you‚Äôre at it!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Total cost: ~$60, not including the SD card writer.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-initial-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-set-up">Task 1: Initial
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W set up</h3>
<p>In this task, we‚Äôll install an operating system (OS) on the Raspberry
Pi Zero 2 W, by loading it onto the microSD card.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plug the SD card writer into your computer, and put the microSD
card into it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/sd-writer.jpeg" alt="Photo of SD card in writer" />

</figure></li>
<li><p>Install the Raspberry Pi Imager application on your computer, by
selecting the correct ‚ÄúDownload for Windows/macOS‚Äù option on this page:
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi
Imager</a></p></li>
<li><p>Open the Raspberry Pi Imager application, and make the following
selections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Device: <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong></li>
<li>Operating System: <strong>Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)</strong>, ‚ÄúA
port of Debian Bookworm with no desktop environment‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>This option may be nested under the ‚ÄúRaspberry Pi OS (other)‚Äù folder
and require a little bit of searching.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-0.png"
alt="Screenshot of Operating System selection dialog" />


</figure>
<ul>
<li>Storage: <strong>Generic - SD/MicroSD Media</strong>, which is the
microSD card that‚Äôs currently in the writer</li>
</ul>
<p>Your resultant selection screen should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-1.png"
alt="Screenshot of selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text" />


</figure>
<p>‚Ä¶select <strong><code>NEXT</code></strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to optionally ‚ÄúApply OS customization
settings?‚Äù Select <strong><code>EDIT SETTINGS</code></strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-4.png"
alt="Screenshot of additional selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<p>and then on the following page, set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostname:
<strong><code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></strong>,
<ul>
<li>This will be the name of the Raspberry Pi, e.g.,
<code>birdnet-foo</code>, <code>birdnet-backyard</code>,
<code>birdnet-007</code>, whatever! The identifier I chose in these
screenshots is <code>hannex</code>, such that my full hostname is
<code>birdnet-hannex</code>.</li>
<li>Make it something unique enough that if you set up multiple
birdnets, you‚Äôll be able to keep them separate. I typically use the
initials of the recipient.</li>
<li><em>Note that the angle brackets (‚Äú&lt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù) here and elsewhere
in this tutorial should not be included in your chosen
<code>&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code>; they are simply convention used to
indicate the user-specific parts of variables.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Username and password:
<strong><code>&lt;pi_username&gt;</code></strong> /
<strong><code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>This will be the username and password for the Raspberry Pi. I use
<code>birbwatcher</code> as the username for all of mine, so that‚Äôs what
you‚Äôll see in my screenshots. Make sure to write these values down
somewhere, as you‚Äôll need them whenever you want to log into your
Pi!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configure wireless LAN:
<strong><code>&lt;your_current_wifi_network_name&gt;</code></strong> /
<strong><code>&lt;your_current_wifi_network_password&gt;</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>Important note 1: This must be the Wi-Fi network name (‚ÄúSSID‚Äù) and
password for the Wi-Fi network your computer is <em>currently
using</em>, and that you‚Äôll be using for the rest of the Pi setup. If
you‚Äôre setting this device up for someone else, there‚Äôll be a separate
step to additionally add <em>their</em> Wi-Fi network info later; for
now, this should be yours.</li>
<li>Important note 2: If you have a 5 GHz option network (e.g.,
<code>MyFunWifiNetwork</code> and <code>MyFunWifiNetwork_5G</code>, do
NOT use the 5G one! At time of writing, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W‚Äôs do not
support it.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure the time zone is correct for wherever your BirdNET-Pi will
be installed.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-2.png"
alt="Screenshot of selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<ul>
<li>Under the <em><code>SERVICES</code></em> tab, confirm that
<code>enable SSH</code> and <code>use password authentication</code> are
both selected‚Äîthey likely already are, by default.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/pi-image-3.png"
alt="Screenshot of additional selection dialog, with choices matching those described in the above text." />


</figure>
<p>‚Ä¶select <strong><code>SAVE</code></strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>You‚Äôll be reprompted to ‚ÄúApply OS customization settings?‚Äù This
time select <code>YES</code>. You might get a scary looking message
asking you to confirm that any existing data on the card will be
overwritten; select <code>YES</code> to continue. If prompted for a
password, use the password for the computer you‚Äôre running the
configuration from‚Äînot any of the passwords we‚Äôve now set for the
Pi.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Imager will now proceed to write the operating
system and configuration settings to your microSD card! It may take a
few minutes, but the progress bar will tell you when its done, and the
microSD card will be automatically disconnected from your computer
(‚Äúejected‚Äù) once the writing is complete. At that point it will be safe
to remove the card from the writer.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the microSD card from the writer and put it into the
microSD card slot in the Raspberry Pi 2 Zero W.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the power cable to one of the Pi‚Äôs micro USB ports, and
plug its other end into the wall. Once powered, the Pi will turn on
automatically; you‚Äôll know the Pi is on because a green light will start
flashing on the Pi. This may take a few moments.</p></li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>Congratulations, you‚Äôve now installed the operating system on your
Pi! When the Pi boots up, it will automatically use the Wi-Fi
credentials you provided to connect to your wireless network. We can‚Äîand
will!‚Äîdo the rest of the setup wirelessly.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-ssh-timetalk-to-the-pi">Task 2: SSH time‚Äîtalk to the
Pi</h3>
<p>In this task, we‚Äôll ‚ÄúSSH onto the Pi‚Äù, i.e., send commands to it from
another computer. It is barely worthy of its own section in this
tutorial, but giving it one should make it easier to find again when
your future self inevitably forgets the single command. :D</p>
<p>Why do we do this? In the previous task we chose the ‚ÄúLite‚Äù operating
system for our Pi, which means we configured the Pi to run in ‚Äúheadless‚Äù
mode‚Äîi.e., without a dedicated monitor, keyboard, or mouse. To interact
with the Pi in the absence of those peripherals, we connect to it
remotely over a wireless network, using a communication protocol called
the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell
Protocol (SSH)</a>.</p>
<p>Once your Pi is powered on, <strong>as long as your personal computer
is on the same Wi-Fi network you configured the Pi to connect
to</strong> you‚Äôll be able to SSH onto it from your personal computer.
(I‚Äôve put that bit in bold because it is mission critical!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When a step says ‚Äúrun‚Äù, that means to type or copy the given text
into the terminal and then hit the <code>Enter</code> or
<code>Return</code> key.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>SSH onto the device: on your personal computer, open up a
terminal application. If you‚Äôre on a Mac, this is literally called
<strong>Terminal</strong>; on Windows it‚Äôs called <strong>Windows
Terminal</strong>. Run</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
<p>To SSH onto the device I configured in the earlier screenshots, I do
<code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex.local</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/ssh.png"
alt="Screenshot of ssh connection window." />


</figure></li>
<li><p>If prompted to continue connecting, type <code>yes</code> and hit
<code>enter</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you just hit <code>enter</code> without typing <code>yes</code>,
you will not be connected, and it might get confusing. Try step 1 again,
and this time type <code>yes</code> at the prompt!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When prompted for a password, type the
<code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> from above (without the angle
brackets!!) and hit <code>enter</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre on! Any commands you type into this terminal
window will now be running <em>on your Raspberry Pi</em>. üòÆ If you want
to close the SSH connection? Simply type <code>exit</code> and hit
<code>enter</code>, or close the terminal‚Äôs application window by
clicking on the X in the corner of the window.</p>
<p>If your SSH connection drops at any time‚Äîyour internet chokes, you
decide it‚Äôs bedtime and want to finish another day, you accidentally
close your terminal window, you intentionally close your terminal
window‚Äîsimply SSH back on again.</p>

<summary>
<strong><em>Click for more details on understanding to which machine
you‚Äôre sending terminal commands</em></strong>
</summary>
<p><em>In the terminal window, how can you tell which machine you‚Äôre
sending commands to? How can you tell if your SSH connection is running
or has dropped?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look at the start of each line: when you‚Äôre on the Pi, the
‚Äúprompt‚Äù‚Äîthe default text at the start of a line in your terminal‚Äîwill
be <code>&lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code>. When
you‚Äôre on your personal machine, it will be something else‚Äîprobably the
name of your computer unless you‚Äôve customized it to look different.</p>
<figure>

<p>In this screenshot, my local prompt is the path to my working
directory (‚Äú~‚Äù) in a blue arrow, while the prompt on the Pi is the white
<code>birdnet-hannex:~/BirdNET-Pi$</code>. The text styling will likely
be different in your terminal, but the concept is the same.</p>
<p>You can try out typing the same series of prompts as I did in this
screenshot‚Äîanything on the blue or white lines‚Äîand you should see
similar if not identical responses on your machines.</p></li>

<h3 id="task-3-birdnet-pi-application-installation">Task 3: BirdNET-Pi
application installation</h3>
<p>Okay. You‚Äôve set up the Pi, you‚Äôve ssh‚Äôd onto the Pi‚Äîit‚Äôs time to add
the ‚ÄúBirdNET‚Äù part of BirdNET-Pi!</p>
<p>In this task, we‚Äôll download and run the installer for the BirdNET-Pi
application and then change some of the Pi‚Äôs configuration for storage
limits, restart behavior, and logging. Some of the following is going to
seem a little silly, but it works. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Bear with me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you‚Äôre prompted for a password at any point in this task, use
the <code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> you set previously.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In your remote terminal‚Äîthat is, a terminal window in which
you‚Äôve SSH‚Äôd onto your Pi‚Äîrun</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new file at path <code>/etc/rc.local</code> and
open it in a program called <strong>nano</strong>, which is a text
editor that runs in the terminal.</p>
<p>Using your arrow keys and keyboard as with a regular text editor,
Edit the file so its contents are exactly as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh -e
iw wlan0 set power_save off
exit 0</code></pre>
<p>To do this you can either type these contents in manually, or copy
and paste the contents using <code>ctrl+c</code>/<code>ctrl+v</code>
commands, as with any other text editor.</p>
<p>To exit this file, press <code>ctrl</code> and <code>x</code> at the
same time; then <code>y</code> to save the modifications, then
<code>enter</code> to select the path you originally opened as the save
path. You will then be returned back to your command prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Want to confirm that you wrote and saved the correct content to
this file? Run</p>
<pre><code>cat /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
<p>to display the file contents in the terminal. If the displayed
content matches the text above, you‚Äôre good to go‚Äîif it doesn‚Äôt, simply
do <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> to reopen the file in your
editor and try again!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To make the file you just created executable, i.e., to enable the
computer to run it, run</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod u+x /etc/rc.local</code></pre>
<p>in the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>To update the Pi‚Äôs swap space limits, run</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile</code></pre>
<p>to open the file <code>/etc/dphys-swapfile</code> in nano.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use the down arrow to scroll through the file to the line that
says <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=512</code> and edit it to be
<code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048</code></p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the line that reads
<code>#CONF_MAXSWAP=2048</code> and edit it to be
<code>CONF_MAXSWAP=4096</code> (Note the lack of <code>#</code> at the
beginning of the line!!).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Your resultant file should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/screenshot-swapfile.png"
alt="Screenshot of text file with the above settings set." />


</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A <code>#</code> at the start of the line means that the line is
commented out‚Äîwhich means that the changes on that line will be ignored.
We do not want them to be ignored, hence deleting the relevant
<code>#</code>!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To save the changes, press <code>ctrl</code> and <code>x</code>
together, then <code>y</code>, followed by <code>enter</code>; once
again you‚Äôll be returned to the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>In the terminal, run <code>sudo reboot</code>. This will cause
the Pi to‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîreboot, which will automatically close your SSH
connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for a moment or two for the Pi to reboot, then SSH back onto
it:</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
<p>(Look familiar? :) )</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, this is the bit that is going to feel silly. Just go with
it. In your remote terminal, start the BirdNET-Pi installation script by
running</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
<p>A bunch of text will print out to the screen, as various files and
dependencies are copied onto the Pi. You don‚Äôt have to pay attention to
that text‚Äîyou just have to wait and wait, <em>until the installation
fails</em>. This may take a long time, on the order of tens of
minutes.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs right: eventually, <strong>the installation script you just
ran will fail(!)</strong> with a ‚ÄúNo space left on device‚Äù error. That‚Äôs
expected! You want it to happen!<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/screenshot-failure.png"
alt="Screenshot of failure message." />


</figure></li>
<li><p>Okay, let‚Äôs fix the out-of-space error. Run the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -o remount,size=5G /tmp/</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now re-run the installation step, first deleting the failed
installation directory:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf BirdNET-Pi/
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
<p>This step is slow, as lots of things happen during installation. Be
patient!</p>
<p>This time the installation script should succeed. You‚Äôll know it has
succeeded because the Pi will reboot, which will close your SSH
connection.</p>
<p>If it does NOT succeed, i.e., you still get a failure message when
you run that <code>curl</code> command, repeat the commands in this
step. Try this a couple times before giving up and emailing me that my
instructions did not work for you!<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/screenshot-success.png"
alt="Screenshot of failure message." />


</figure></li>
<li><p>SSH back on to your Pi again! I bet you remember the command this
time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You can also probably use the up-arrows in your terminal to page
back through the previous terminal command history, which at this point
definitely contains your SSH command! You can hit <code>enter</code> on
any item in the command history to rerun it.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now edit the amount of storage space the system logs are allowed
to use: run</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf</code></pre>
<p>which will dump you into yet another file in your text editor!</p>
<p>Use the arrow keys to scroll down to the line that says
<code>#SystemMaxUse=</code> and remove the <code>#</code> to change the
line to be <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code></p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/screenshot-journal.png"
alt="Screenshot of journal config with requisite change made." />


</figure>
<p>and then save the file: <code>ctrl+x</code> , <code>Y</code>,
<code>enter</code>. You‚Äôre now a pro at this in-terminal text editor
stuff!</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the logging with those new settings by running</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Congrats! You‚Äôve now installed the BirdNET-Pi application! üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ The
finicky part is over.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-configure-the-birdnet-pi-application">Task 4: Configure
the BirdNET-Pi application</h3>
<p>The BirdNET-Pi application consists of two components: a
classification pipeline that constantly analyzes recorded audio for bird
sounds, and a small web server that hosts a website that visualizes
those detections. The website also lets users (you!) configure the
application‚Äôs various settings. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be doing in this
task.</p>
<p>For the following steps, use whatever browser on your computer you
prefer‚ÄîChrome, Firefox, whatever. Note that the BirdNET-Pi website will
be slow to load and respond, which is to be expected: remember that it

empty.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the default credentials of the BirdNET-Pi
<em>application</em>, as defined in the installation script we just ran,
rather than any of the credentials we configured previously for the Pi
itself. If you want to change this default, you can do that on the

<li>I don‚Äôt want the ability to hear the recorded audio stream live, so
it is a waste of compute power to leave it on and possibly slow
everything else down; and</li>

<p>For both these services, be sure to select <code>Disable</code>

<p>Note that it may take a few seconds to a minute for each setting to
update after being clicked; that‚Äôs to be expected! Your Pi is working
very hard to analyze birds and handle website requests at the same time!
Have patience. If you‚Äôre taken to a different screen with a black

(Optional): Install Tailscale for remote monitoring</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre gifting this BirdNET-Pi to someone else who wants you to
act as tech support for their installation, or you want to be able to
check on your own installation while you‚Äôre not connected to your home
Wi-Fi network, you can add your Pi to a <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> network‚Äîbasically, it acts
as a virtual private network for your various devices.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong><em>Click to see instructions</em></strong>
</summary>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/welcome">Sign up</a>
for a Tailscale account, if you don‚Äôt already have one.</p>
<p>You do not need to do anything other than choose (or make) an account
to sign in with. You don‚Äôt need to bother following their steps to ‚Äúadd
a first device‚Äù unless you want to, you can do it later.</p></li>
<li><p>In your terminal, SSH onto the Pi and install Tailscale by
running</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/raspbian/bullseye.noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg &gt; /dev/null
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/raspbian/bullseye.tailscale-keyring.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tailscale</code></pre>
<p>(If prompted, type <code>Y</code> and enter to confirm
installation.)</p></li>
<li><p>To connect your Pi to your Tailscale network, run</p>
<pre><code>sudo tailscale up</code></pre>
<p>This will result in a prompt with a URL link to click. Follow that
link by <code>command</code>-clicking it or pasting it into your
browser! It will ask you to agree to connect this new device to your
Tailscale network; follow through with whatever verification steps it
asks you to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that if you want to connect the device to <em>someone
else‚Äôs</em> Tailscale network, you‚Äôll need to send <em>them</em> the
generated URL and have them authorize it with their own Tailscale
account.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/ssh-tailscale.png"
alt="Screenshot of tailscale installation" />


</figure></li>
<li><p>Your Pi should now show up on your <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">Tailscale
console</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you won‚Äôt have easy access to the device in the future,
consider setting <code>... &gt; Disable key expiry</code> on that Pi in
the Tailscale web console.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/site-tailscaleconsole.png"
alt="Screenshot of Tailscale console" />


</figure></li>
<li><p>Optional: If this is your first time using Tailscale, you‚Äôll need
to additionally install it on whatever device you plan to use to access
the BirdNET-Pi‚Äîe.g., I have it installed on both my personal computer
and my phone. Steps for these different devices are available <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation">in their
documentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, from any device on your Tailscale network, you can SSH onto
your Pi through that network, and no longer need to be on the same
wireless network! Try this by opening a new Terminal window and
running</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note the lack of <code>.local</code> at the end of the host name!
E.g. over Tailscale I now do <code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex</code>
instead of <code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex.local</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, you can view the Pi‚Äôs website via your Tailscale
network, so that you no longer have to be on the same wireless network
as the Pi! You‚Äôll still need to do this from a machine that is part of
your Tailscale network‚Äîthis url won‚Äôt work from a machine that isn‚Äôt,
i.e., you can‚Äôt just give the URL to a friend and expect it to work.</p>
<p>Find the Pi‚Äôs URL in your Tailscale console. E.g., for my device, the
console shows its address as</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/ts-url.png"
alt="Screenshot of console with address" />


</figure>
<p>so I access mine at
<code>http://birdnet-hannex.feist-matrix.ts.net/</code>. If you go to
that address, you will not be able to see anything‚Äîbecause you are not
part of my Tailscale network.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That‚Äôs it!</p>
<p>While SSH‚Äôd onto the Pi, you can do <code>sudo tailscale down</code>
to disconnect it from the VPN, or <code>sudo tailscale up</code> to
reconnect. (<code>tailscale status</code> will tell you whether you are
currently connected or not.)</p>
<p>If you are giving the Pi to someone else, and only want it to be
available on your Tailscale network when they specifically enables
it‚Äîand they are willing and able to interact with a terminal
themselves!‚Äîyou can <code>sudo tailscale down</code> for now, and then
give them instructions to SSH on and do a <code>sudo tailscale up</code>
when needed.</p>

<p>TODO-HERE</p>
<p>There may be multiple Wi-Fi networks to which you want the Pi to
auto-connect when in range. For example, when I set up a BirdNET-Pi for
someone else, I want it to recognize my home network‚Äîduring setup, and
for quality checking before I send it off!‚Äîas well as the network of the
home I‚Äôm sending it to. Perhaps you additionally want to allow your Pi
to connect to your phone‚Äôs hotspot, so that you can take it with you on
various outdoor adventures?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"

<h3 id="task-7-physical-installation">Task 7: Physical installation</h3>
<p>TODO-HERE</p>
<p>Time to stick that microphone out a window!</p>
<p>While you <em>could</em> just unplug your Pi, it‚Äôs safer for the Pi
(less chance of something going wrong!) to intentionally power it down
first. While SSH‚Äôd onto the Pi, do <code>sudo shutdown</code>.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Now go find a window and stick your microphone out it! I‚Äôve included
some photos of my own setup as inspiration. Once the microphone can
access the great outoors (presumably, somewhere where you‚Äôve heard at
least one bird recently!), plug it into the remaining micro-USB port on
the Pi. Plug the Pi into whatever outlet is accessible, and wait!</p>
<p>In your choice of microphone location, be mindful of whether anything
will get wet if it rains (bad!), especially if that thing is the Pi
(very very bad! do not do this). As an example, here is what my
installation looks like:</p>
<div class="centered-children">
<figure>

<figcaption style="font-size:smaller">
My exceptionally professional looking setup. Note the piece of white
tape for sticking the Pi to the wall, and the piece of black tape, for
covering up the Pi‚Äôs bright green light, which otherwise is annoyingly
bright at night.

</div>
<div class="centered-children">
<figure>
<img src="../birdnet-intro/assets/mic.png" alt="Photo of microphone in dirty windowsill"/>
<figcaption style="font-size:smaller">
A view of the microphone, and also of my exceedingly dirty inner window
frame. I was so horrified by this photo that I considered cleaning it
out and taking a new photo. As you can see, I did not do that. Also, I
just slide the window shut over top of the wire; the window isn‚Äôt so
snug that it is a problem. We did a similarly half-assed installation
out of my parents‚Äô window, which was also sufficient for bird detection!
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Once powered, the analysis service and web server will start right
away, and the Pi will autoconnect to the Wi-Fi network that you
configured it for, which means that you will be able to see what it‚Äôs
doing via <code>foo.local</code> on another device (phone, laptop) as
long as that device is on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>Once your BirdNET-Pi is up and running, anyone connected to your home
Wi-Fi network can view the latest birds at
<code>birdnet-foo.local</code>. Anyone connected to your tailscale
network can see the same via <code>birdnet-foo.TODO</code>.</p>
<p>Click around to explore what‚Äôs visible to you; note that the TODO and
TODO tabs won‚Äôt show anything, since we disabled those services (above).
Until you‚Äôve detected a few birds, the app will seem pretty boring and
janky, but leave the microphone plugged in for a bit and then recheck
it! The page may be a bit slow to load‚Äîremember that this site is being
served entirely from that little Raspberry Pi Zero you just set up, and
in addition to making the website you‚Äôre trying to view, it is also
constantly recording and analyzing sound. It‚Äôs doing the best it
can.</p>
<h2 id="daily-usage">Daily usage</h2>
<p>To view the website being broadcast by your Pi,
http://birdnet-foo.local. To access this site, you‚Äôll need to be on the
same Wi-Fi network that your Pi is connected to.</p>
<p>If you did the optional Tailscale installation, you can additionally
view your site at http://birdnet-foo.<TODO>.ts.net/.</p>
<p>Optional niceties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a sign in your home with a link to the site, to show visitors
how to connect to your Wi-Fi and then view your birds</li>
<li>If you have an old display of some sort, you can set up a
semi-permanent viewing station. My parents mounted an old iPad near the
window with the BirdNET installation, and set its default landing page
to view your BirdNET-Pi detections.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"

details</h3>
<p>Your BirdNET-Pi is now running! Awesome! Congrats! Uh‚Ä¶what if
something goes wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>If your power goes out, or your Wi-Fi router resets, the Pi will
automatically reconnect and start back up.</li>
<li>If your Pi is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi for whatever reason,
BirdNET will continue to run its detection and analysis; you just won‚Äôt
be able to connect to it (i.e., see the website for your installation)
until the Pi has connected to the Wi-Fi again.</li>
<li>If your internet is out but your Wi-Fi router is still running,
you‚Äôll still be able to see your Pi‚Äôs website</li>
<li>If you are unable to load your Pi‚Äôs website from another device,
check the following (in roughly this order):
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the Pi plugged into power? Is the green light on it flashing (to
indicate that it is powered)?</li>
<li>Is the Pi able to access the wireless network it was configured to
run on? i.e., is that network accessible and can you connect to it with
another device (i.e., your phone, a laptop, etc)?</li>
<li>(If you aren‚Äôt running tailscale) Is the device you‚Äôre trying to
view the website from connected to the <em>same network as the device
is</em>? This is the gotcha question‚Ä¶if they aren‚Äôt on the same network,
the website won‚Äôt be viewable. (This means if your phone is on the 5g
home network and your Pi is on the regular network, you won‚Äôt be able to
view the website.)</li>
<li>(If you are running tailscale) Does the device you‚Äôre trying to view
the website from have tailscale enabled? Are you loading the site
through its tailscale address (TODO) rather than FOO.local (TODO)?</li>
<li>Can you connect to the Pi via ssh? If the Pi is powered and
connected to the Wi-Fi,</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you set the device up for someone else and it turns out you set
up their Wi-Fi password incorrectly, use your phone to create a hotspot
with the same credentials of the Wi-Fi network you were on when you
first set up the Pi (i.e., your home network, if you set this up for
someone else) to get onto the Pi.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>Once the Pi begins to run out of storage space, which won‚Äôt happen
for a long time,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the oldest recordings will be
deleted to make space for newer recordings.
<ul>
<li>You can preempt this ‚Äúloss‚Äù by periodically moving older recordings
off the device to a different storage location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We have now left the happy harbor of this basic installation document
so if you‚Äôre hitting issues here, search around in some of the resource
docs below, or message me or something‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>Data backup:
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs probably a good idea to copy your database off the Pi
periodically. I don‚Äôt do this, but I should, because if the SD card dies
there‚Äôs no way to recover your data. TODO-instructions</li>
<li>Also more minimal instructions sans recordings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If you use these instructions‚Äîor are otherwise inspired to set up a
BirdNET-Pi of your own‚Äîplease let me know! If anything is unclear or
broken, <strong>please tell me</strong>. If you know me in real life and
