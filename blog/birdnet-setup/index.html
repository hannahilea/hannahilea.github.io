      <p>The individual steps were sourced from existing documentation—that I’ll cite when used!—but this guide exists because I haven’t found a similar single source of truth with this level of minutia.</p>
      <p>
        This setup guide came from the notes I wrote for myself so that I could replicate the setup, along with tweaks made when I updated that first installation and set up two more (one for myself, another for my parents). My longest
        running BirdNET installation—the gift for my dad—has nearly 9 months under its belt now, and has run remarkably smoothly, modulo one hickup due to some overzealous logging bringing down the entire system.

            >My goal here is to make it trivially easy to get a new BirdNET-Pi installation up and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. These instructions are intentionally verbose, written for folks who use computers but don’t consider
            themselves programmers, and/or folks who have never worked with a Raspberry Pi before. If you fit this description but find that the instructions fall short, please let me know!</em

        <p>Here are the tasks we’ll be stepping through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>0: Acquire components</li>
          <li>1: Initial Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W set up</li>
          <li>2: SSH time—talk to the Pi</li>
          <li>3: BirdNET-Pi application installation</li>
          <li>4 (optional): Install Tailscale for remote monitoring</li>
          <li>5 (optional): Set up additional Wi-Fi networks</li>
          <li>6: Configure the BirdNET-Pi application</li>
          <li>7: Physical installation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While it may look like there’s a lot here, it is a straight-forward “a lot”, without implicit steps that require leaving this page. Don’t be nervous—you’ve got this!</p>
        <p>Also: I ran this setup from my personal computer, which happens to be a Mac. If you’re on a Windows machine the screenshots might not exactly match what you see, see but the steps are the same.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The step that requires an SD card writer is relatively brief and first on the list, so you could easily get away with borrowing a friend’s, rather than buying your own—especially if you set up a BirdNET-Pi for them while
                you’re at it!

          <li><p>Plug the SD card writer into your computer, and put the microSD card into it.</p></li>
          <li>

              You’ll be prompted to optionally “Apply OS customization settings?”, which you should accept by choosing <strong><code>EDIT SETTINGS</code></strong

                Hostname: <strong><code>birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code></strong

                <code>hannex</code>.
                <ul>
                  <li>Make it something unique enough that if you set up multiple birdnets, you’ll be able to keep them separate. I typically use the initials of the recipient.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Username and password: <strong><code>&lt;pi_username&gt;</code></strong> /
                <strong><code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code></strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>This will be the username and password for the Raspberry Pi. I use <code>birbwatcher</code> as the username for each of mine, so that’s what you’ll see in my screenshots.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Important: this is the Wi-Fi network name (“SSID”) and password for the Wi-Fi network your computer is <em>currently using</em>, and that you’ll be using for the rest of the set up steps. If you’re setting this device up
                    for someone else, there’ll be a separate step to add <em>their</em> Wi-Fi network info later; for now, this should be yours.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Make sure the time zone is correct for wherever your birdnet will be <em>installed</em>.</li>
              <li>
                Under the <em><code>SERVICES</code></em> tab, confirm that <code>enable SSH</code> and <code>use password authentication</code> are both selected (they likely already are, by default).

          <li><p>Eject the microSD card from the reader. TODO-confirm how to do this.</p></li>
          <li><p>Put the microSD card into the SD card slot of the Pi:</p></li>

        <p>TODO-photo</p>
        <ol start="8" type="1">
          <li>
            Connect the power cable to one of the Pi’s micro USB ports, and plug the other end into the wall. Once powered, the Pi will turn on automatically, which you’ll know has happened because a green light will start flashing on the
            Pi. This may take a few moments!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After powering on, the Pi will use the Wi-Fi credentials you just gave it to automatically connect to your wireless network. The rest of the setup will be done wirelessly!</p>
        <h3 id="task-2-ssh-timetalk-to-the-pi">Task 2: SSH time—talk to the Pi</h3>
        <p>This step is barely worthy of its own section, but giving it a header should make it easier for you to find again when you inevitably forget how to connect. :D</p>
        <p>
          By choosing the “Lite” operating system in the previous task, we configured the Pi to run “headless”—which means, without a dedicated monitor, keyboard, or mouse. To interact with it without those things, we’ll connect to it
          remotely over the wireless network, via a protocol called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>.
          <strong><em>As long as your personal computer is on the same Wi-Fi network you configured the Pi to connect to</em></strong> and the Pi is powered, you’ll be able to SSH onto it.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>On your personal computer, open up your terminal application—if you’re on a Mac, this is literally called “Terminal”; on Windows it’s called “Windows Terminal”—and type</p>
            <pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
            <p>E.g., to SSH onto the device in my screenshots above, I do <code>ssh birbwatcher@birdnet-hannex.local</code>.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./assets/ssh.png" alt="TODO-cation" />
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When prompted to continue connecting, type <code>yes</code> and hit “enter”. (This will only happen the first time you connect.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When prompted for a password, type the <code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> from above and hit “enter”.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That’s it, you’re on! Any commands you type in this window will now be run <em>on your Raspberry Pi</em>. 😮</p>
        <p>Oh, and if you want to exit the SSH connection? Type <code>exit</code> (and hit enter).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/ssh2.png" alt="TODO-caption" />
        </figure>
        <p>In your terminal window, how can you tell which machine you’re sending commands to? How can you tell if your SSH connection is running or has dropped?</p>
        <p>
          Look at the start of each line: when you’re on the Pi, the “prompt”—the default text at the start of the line in your terminal—will be <code>&lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;</code>. When you’re on your personal
          machine, it will be something else, probably the name of your computer unless you’ve customized it to look different. In these screenshots, my local prompt is the path to my working directory “~” in a blue arrow, and the prompt on
          the Pi is the white <code>birdnet-hannex</code>. The text styling may look different for yours, but the concept is the same.
        </p>
        <p>If your SSH connection drops at any time—your internet chokes, you decide it’s bedtime and want to finish another day, you accidentally close your terminal window—simply SSH back on again.</p>
        <h3 id="task-3-birdnet-pi-application-installation">Task 3: BirdNET-Pi application installation</h3>
        <p>Okay. You’ve set up the pi, you’ve ssh’d onto the pi—it’s time to add the “BirdNET” part of BirdNET-Pi!</p>
        <p>
          In this step, we’ll: - Download and run the installer for the BirdNET-Pi application - Change some of the Pi’s configuration around storage limits, restart behavior, and logging, so that it allows the BirdNET-Pi application to run
          more effectively on a smaller machine than it was originally designed around.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the following is going to seem a little silly, but it works. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Bear with me! Basically what we’re doing in this step is:</p>
        <p>For any of the following steps, if you’re prompted for a password use <code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code>.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              In your remote terminal—that is, the one where you SSH’d onto your Pi—type <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> This will open up a new file in nano, which is a terminal-based text editor. Copy and paste the following into it:
              <code>#!/bin/sh -e iw wlan0 set power_save off exit 0</code> Do <code>ctrl-x</code> (TODO-Windows) to close the file, and <code>Y</code> + “enter” to save these changes. The file will be saved and you’ll be dumped back to a
              command prompt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Want to confirm that you write and saved the correct thing? Type <code>cat /etc/rc.local</code> to print the contents of that file to the terminal. If it matches the above text, you’re good to go—if it doesn’t, do
              <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> again and edit it so that it matches!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Run <code>sudo chmod u+x /etc/rc.local</code>. This makes the new file you just made executable (i.e. runnable).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Update the swap space limits! Type <code>sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile</code> to be dumped back in the nano text editor! Then use the arrow keys to scroll down to find and update the lines that contain
              <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE</code> and <code>CONF_MAXSWAP</code> and edit them to:
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Remove a <code>#</code> from the start of the line, if present, and</li>
              <li>
                Update them so that they read <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048 CONF_MAXSWAP=4096</code> A <code>#</code> at the start of the line means that the line is commented out—i.e., none of your changes will be applied, and the default value
                will continue to be used.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Do <code>ctrl+x</code> and <code>Y</code> to save these changes; once more, you’ll be returned to the terminal!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Type <code>sudo reboot</code>. This will cause the pi to—you guessed it—reboot, which will automatically close your ssh connection.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Wait for a moment or two for your Pi to reboot, then SSH back onto it:</p>
            <pre><code>ssh &lt;pi_username&gt;@birdnet-&lt;pi_identifier&gt;.local</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Okay, this is the bit that is going to feel silly. Just go with it. In your remote command prompt, run</p>
            <pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
            <p>A bunch of text will print out to the screen, but you don’t have to pay attention. Eventually, it WILL eventually fail with a “No space left on device” error. That’s expected! You want it to happen!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After you’ve gotten the error, type (or paste) the following at the prompt:</p>
            <pre><code>sudo mount -o remount,size=5G /tmp/
rm -rf BirdNET-Pi/
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash</code></pre>
            <p>…when it succeeds this time (eventually! This step is slow, lots of things happen during installation), the pi will reboot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>…SSH back on again! I bet you remember the command this time. You can also probably use the up-arrows in your terminal to see the last command you typed in the terminal’s history, which was probably your SSH command.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do: <code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf</code> which will dump you into yet another file in the text editor.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Replace <code>#SystemMaxUse=</code> with <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and</li>
              <li>Save the file ( <code>ctrl+x</code> , <code>Y</code>!).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do <code>systemctl restart systemd-journald</code>, which will require you to enter your <code>&lt;pi_password&gt;</code> when prompted.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>At this point, the BirdNET-Pi application has been installed!</p>

        <p>
          If you’re gifting this birdnet to someone else who wants you to act as tech support for their installation, or you want to be able to check on your own installation while you’re not connected to your home Wi-Fi network, you can
          add your pi to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> network—basically, it acts as a virtual private network for your various devices.
        </p>

        <pre><code>sudo tailscale up</code></pre>
        <p>This will result in a prompt for what to do next, with a linked URL to click. Follow that prompt! It will basically just ask you to agree that you want to connect this new device to your Tailscale network.</p>
        <pre><code>- Note that if you want to connect the device to *someone else&#39;s* Tailscale network, you&#39;ll need to send *them* the generated URL and have them authorize it with their Tailscale network. </code></pre>

          </li>
          <li>

            <p>
              If this is your first time using Tailscale, also install it on whatever device you want to use to access the birdnet—e.g., your personal computer, or your phone. Steps for these different devices are available
              <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="TODO-link">here</a>.
            </p>

        <p>Huzzah!</p>
        <p>
          When ssh’d onto the pi, you can do <code>sudo tailscale down</code> to disconnect from the VPN, or <code>sudo tailscale up</code> to reconnect. (<code>tailscale status</code> tells you whether you are currently connected or not.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are giving the pi to someone else, and only want it to be available to your Tailscale network when that giftee specifically enables it—and they are willing and able to interact with a terminal themselves!—you can
          <code>sudo tailscale down</code> for now, and then give them instructions to SSH on and do a <code>sudo tailscale up</code> when needed.

        <p>
          There may be multiple Wi-Fi networks to which you want the pi to auto-connect when in range. For example, when I set up a birdnet for someone else, I want it to autojoin my home network—for quality checking before I send it
          off!—as well as the network of the home I’m sending it to. Perhaps you want to allow your pi to connect to your phone’s hotspot, so that you can take it with you on various outdoor adventures?<a

            <p>e.g., for a network named <code>SuperBoringNetwork381</code> with password <code>reallysecurepassword</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>sudo nmcli connection add \
    type wifi \
    wifi.ssid &quot;SuperBoringNetwork381&quot; \

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>…that’s it! You can check to see what you’ve set up with <code>nmcli device wifi list</code></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For now, you can close your terminal window to close your SSH connection if you want—we won’t need it anymore.</p>
        <h3 id="task-6-configure-the-birdnet-pi-application">Task 6: Configure the BirdNET-Pi application</h3>
        <p>
          The BirdNET-Pi application has two components: a classification pipeline that constantly analyzes recorded audio for bird sounds, and a small web server that hosts a website that visualizes those detections. The website also lets
          users configure the application’s various settings. That’s what we’ll be doing in this task!
        </p>
        <p>For the following steps, use whatever browser on your computer you prefer: Chrome, Firefox, whatever.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              In your browser of choice, go to the website

              >). Note that this site will <em>only work</em> if you are visiting it from a machine on the same Wi-Fi network that your pi is currently connected to!
            </p>
            <p>You should see something like this, only with no detections yet:</p>

                This is the default username and password of the BirdNET-Pi <em>application</em>, which we have not yet set! If you want to change it, you can do that on the settings page; I haven’t bothered to change mine because I trust
                anyone who I’ve granted access to my Wi-Fi network not to mess with my BirdNET-Pi settings.

                <ol type="1">
                  <li>I don’t want the ability to hear the recorded audio stream live, so it is a waste of compute power to leave it on, potentially slowing everything else down; and</li>
                  <li>It makes it too easy to accidentally is a potential privacy violation, as the live audio hasn’t been analyzed yet so doesn’t bypass/throw out any human sounds.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>Disable</code> the <code>Streamlit Statistics</code></strong

              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For both these services, be sure to select <code>Disable</code> instead of <code>Stop</code>; the former will persist after reboot, the latter will only halt the service until reboot.</p>
            <p>Note that it may take a few seconds to a minute for these settings to update after being clicked; your pi is working very hard to analyze birds and handle website requests at the same time! Have patience.</p>

        <p>Time to stick that microphone out a window!</p>
        <p>While you <em>could</em> just unplug your Pi, it’s safer for the Pi (less chance of something going wrong!) to intentionally power it down first. While SSH’d onto the pi, do TODO</p>
        <p>
          And then plug the pi into whatever outlet is accessible to the pi stuck out the window! Be mindful of whether anything will get wet if it rains (bad!), especially if that thing is the Pi (very very bad! do not do this). As an
          example, here is what my installation looks like:
        </p>

              A view of the microphone, and also of my exceedingly dirty inner window frame. I was so horrified by this photo that I considered cleaning it out and taking a new photo. As you can see, I did not do that. Is there a better
              position for this microphone that might capture the birds better? Probably! This is a sufficient first pass, however. Note that I just slide the window shut over top of the wire; the window isn’t so snug that it is
              problematic. We did a similarly half-assed installation out of my parents’ window as well, and it was similarly sufficient for bird detection!

          Once powered, the analysis service and web server will start right away, and it will autoconnect to the Wi-Fi network that you configured it for, which means that you will be able to see what it’s doing via
          <code>foo.local</code> on another device (phone, laptop) as long as that device is on the same Wi-Fi network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your BirdNET-Pi is up and running, anyone connected to your home Wi-Fi network can view the latest birds at <code>birdnet-foo.local</code>. Anyone connected to your tailscale network can see the same via
          <code>birdnet-foo.TODO</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click around to explore what’s visible to you; note that the TODO and TODO tabs won’t show anything, since we disabled those services (above). Until you’ve detected a few birds, the app will seem pretty boring and janky, but leave
          the microphone plugged in for a bit and then recheck it! The page may be a bit slow to load—remember that this site is being served entirely from that little Raspberry Pi Zero you just set up, and in addition to making the website
          you’re trying to view, it is also constantly recording and analyzing sound. It’s doing the best it can.

        <ul>
          <li>If your power goes out, or your Wi-Fi router resets, the Pi will automatically reconnect and start back up.</li>
          <li>
            If your Pi is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi for whatever reason, BirdNET will continue to run its detection and analysis; you just won’t be able to connect to it (i.e., see the website for your installation) until the Pi has
            connected to the Wi-Fi again.
          </li>
          <li>If your internet is out but your Wi-Fi router is still running, you’ll still be able to see your pi’s website</li>
          <li>
            If you are unable to load your pi’s website from another device, check the following (in roughly this order):
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Is the pi plugged into power? Is the green light on it flashing (to indicate that it is powered)?</li>
              <li>Is the pi able to access the wireless network it was configured to run on? i.e., is that network accessible and can you connect to it with another device (i.e., your phone, a laptop, etc)?</li>
              <li>
                (If you aren’t running tailscale) Is the device you’re trying to view the website from connected to the <em>same network as the device is</em>? This is the gotcha question…if they aren’t on the same network, the website
                won’t be viewable. (This means if your phone is on the 5g home network and your pi is on the regular network, you won’t be able to view the website.)
              </li>
              <li>(If you are running tailscale) Does the device you’re trying to view the website from have tailscale enabled? Are you loading the site through its tailscale address (TODO) rather than FOO.local (TODO)?</li>
              <li>Can you connect to the pi via ssh? If the pi is powered and connected to the Wi-Fi,</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you set the device up for someone else and it turns out you set up their Wi-Fi password incorrectly, use your phone to create a hotspot with the same credentials of the Wi-Fi network you were on when you first set up the pi
            (i.e., your home network, if you set this up for someone else) to get onto the pi.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>

            recordings.

        Oh, and a disclaimer: why haven’t I converted this whole shebang—well, everything after the hardware setup—into a single script that can Just™ be run directly, or opened a pull request against the original BirdNET-Pi repo to modify
        the existing setup script to that effect? Time, mostly. It’s on my list as a follow-up task; in the meantime, the instructions are useable as-is.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>

      <pre><code>scp /PATH/TO/BACKED/UP/birds.db birbwatcher@birdnet-&lt;NAME&gt;.local:/home/birbwatcher/BirdNET-Pi/scripts/birds.db

scp -r /PATH/TO/BACKED/UP/Charts/ birbwatcher@birdnet-&lt;NAME&gt;.local:/home/birbwatcher/BirdSongs/Extracted/

# OPTIONAL: may be a large amount of data, and if you don&#39;t care about playing back the recorded song excerpts, you can skip this

              Fun fact, SD card choice <em>really</em> matters if you’re working with infrasound, e.g., if you’re detecting bat sounds rather than bird sounds—some brands of SD card generate a hum at the same frequency as bats. The more you
              know!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              With the visualization installation, the BirdNET went from being a background piece of trivia to an active obsession—when an issue with logging brought down their installation a few months back, they went into bird monitoring
              withdrawal while I worked to fix it.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              This won’t happen for a long time unless you’re somewhere where the birds yell <em>constantly</em> and you have a smaller SD card than the one recommended above.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"

              Okay, I’ll admit it: I am <strong>super</strong> self-conscious about having spent the time documenting some kinda silly steps (like “run this, wait until it fails, then do X”) instead of spending that time making a single
              clean installation script that doesn’t require so much manual mucking about. HOWEVER. As I keep reminding myself, these are the steps I followed, figuring out parts of it was annoying time-consuming, and the goal here is
              sharing the “how I reproduce my own workflow” steps that <em>I</em> follow when setting up a new BirdNet-Pi. The work to update things upstream is important, but it is a secondary, orthogonal task to sharing what I currently
              have working. So I tell myself. :) Houseplant programming!<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
