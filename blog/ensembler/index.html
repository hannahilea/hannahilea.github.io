        This pitch is for an app that does not yet exist<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and that I’m not planning to build,<a
          href="#fn2"

        but that I would love to use. Please, take this idea. Build this thing. And then let me use it.

      <p><em>Are you interested in playing music with other people, but not sure how to find them?</em></p>
      <p><em>Do you have fond memories of casually playing in various ensembles throughout your school years, but no longer have access to an available pool of other musicians, space to make music in, or relevant equipment?</em></p>
      <p><em>Have you ever had a sudden longing to play some duets, and then remembered that none of your former musical co-conspirators live nearby?</em></p>
      <p><em>You aren’t alone! Enter…</em></p>

      <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center"><strong>Ensembler</strong>, the swipe-to-match app for finding musicians near you!</p>
      <p>
        Simply fill out a few basic profile questions, then peruse the profiles of Ensemblers near you, swiping right or left to indicate interest in meeting up to play together—ensemble! If you both indicate interest, you’ll be able to
        message each other to set up a session. You’ll be making music together in no time!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Moving to a new city used to be so isolating: it would take me years to find my way into the hidden musician networks to find people to play with. Now I can be playing duets with a new acquaintance across the street before I’ve
          even unpacked my dishes.” <br /><br />
          —<em>Ensembler musician (woodwinds)</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="profile-elements">Profile elements</h3>
      <p>Any given profile will include some combination of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Instrument(s) and skill levels at musical activities, e.g., sight reading, preparing sheet music, improvisation, learning by ear, etc.;</p></li>
        <li><p>Type of playing of interest, e.g., playing from notated sheet music or freeform jamming or pre-preparing selected pieces, etc.;</p></li>
        <li><p>Genres of interest;</p></li>
        <li><p>Practice space availability, e.g., whether you have access to a place to meet—and if so, its properties (e.g., amplification, sound-proofing, a drum-set, neighbors, a piano, etc.)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An Ensembler can set up as many sub-profiles as is relevant for them, i.e., one profile for each advanced proficiency clarinet, one for beginner xylophone sight-reading, one for basic piano accompaniment for a vocalist singing show
        tunes, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Thanks to Ensembler, I sightread duets before work twice a week, and I’ve never felt so calm.” <br /><br />
          —<em>Ensembler musician (french horn)</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
      <p>Some of the many features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Ability to set up multiple profiles, for folks who play multiple instruments at various levels.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to bookmark musicians you’ve enjoyed playing with in the past, to be notified of their current jam availability;</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to assemble a whole multi-player ensemble—rock band, string quartet, or polka trio;</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to match with local venues that offer their space for music playing, at a set fee, for those without private practice space access;</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to limit potential matches to those within your known sphere, e.g., only people with whom you have a mutual Ensembler in common or (for younger players) folks who share a professional music teacher.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can also add each other to your pool of on-demand “let’s play ASAP” players, for when you have a sudden urge to play some music and want to broadcast that availability to pre-matched players.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “I’m not a musician myself, but I used to love listening to my kids practice. Now that I’ve made my living room piano available on Ensembler, my neighbors stop by to sing show tunes and practice their sonatas. My home feels lively
          again.” <br /><br />

        <p>
          “I used to be envious of the folks who assembled pick-up bands for Porchfest every year; now I don’t have time to be envious, I’m too busy debating what songs we should prepare with the new friends I made through Ensembler!”
