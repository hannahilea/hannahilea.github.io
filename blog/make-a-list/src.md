I am a big fan of Making A List, whether on paper or digitally.[^skill] 

As taught to me by [Chuck](https://futurestatesband.ca/)[^chuck], **the most important thing about a to-do list is that the first item on it is "Make a list"**. Then, when you've finished adding tasks to your list, you can check it off immediately. Bam, [dopamine](../driven-developments/). Happy day, you're already partly done with your list! Look at you, so much progress already!
My notebook is filled with (partially-completed ðŸ˜…) daily to-do lists, each of which starts with "make a list".

The one type of list I don't regularly start this way is the [punch lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_list) that I often add to pull requests. (Pull requests (PRs) are proposals to merge a set of changes into a set of existing documents, e.g., source code.) PR punch lists both keep me on task and let my reviewers know what subtasks I intentionally considered---and, implicitly, what I did not. (Are you requesting a non-trivial review from me? Bonus points if you include a punch list!)

I've also found that adding a punch list to a [Github PR template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) helps improve review turnaround time and reduces review friction, and sets newer contributors up to succeed more quickly.

[^skill]: This is a different skill than the skill of completing tasks, mind...

[^chuck]: One of the most valuable things I learned in grad school!
