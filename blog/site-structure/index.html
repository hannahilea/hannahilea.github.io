    <h1>This website’s structure: A meta post</h1>
<p>While doing a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse
Center</a>, I revived my personal website—the very site you are almost
certainly looking at Right Now!</p>
<p><img style="border:none;" src="/assets/img/emojis/surprise-pikachu.png"

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I had two goals for this site at the outset:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be trivially easy to set up</strong>, so that my focus could
be on “building new stuff” rather than “building, styling, and
maintaining a website” and</li>
<li><strong>Be trivially easy to update</strong>, so that I can reduce
the friction of sharing projects and (in theory!) get out of my own way
to actually share them.</li>
</ol>
<p>In service of 1, I was hoping to avoid using templating engines, but
was prepared to use one if it was the fastest way to achieve my two
goals. (My limited experience with templating engines in the past has
been a bit frustrating, in that I spend more time trying to understand
and work within/around their confines than I spend working on the
content of said site.)</p>
<p>I asked a bunch of questions of my Recurse batchmates, and got a lot
of good advice from folks with web expertise (have I mentioned that I do
not have web expertise? I myself do not have web expertise!), and was
gratified that their advice boiled down to “just do it in vanilla
html/js”, plus some pointers to reading material/examples/etc. So that’s
what I did!</p>
<p>Now that I’ve been working with it and adding projects to it for a
few months, the structure seems static enough to be worth sharing. If
you are a person who, like me, has cursory web experience and similar
goals for website creation, perhaps this documentation will help you set
up your own site.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The structure is pretty basic:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── README.md
├── add_stuff.jl
├── blog
│   ├── __template
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── &lt;blog-1&gt;
│   ├── ...
│   └── &lt;blog-n&gt;
├── index.html
└── projects
    ├── __template
    ├── index.html
    ├── &lt;project-1&gt;
    ├── ...
    └── &lt;project-n&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There are also some top-level style folders that I’ve excluded here,
as they will likely be reshuffled at some point. (Want to see the full
source? You’re <a
href="https://github.com/hannahilea/hannahilea.github.io/">in
luck</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="blog-subdirectories">Blog subdirectories</h3>
<p>The structure of each blog subdirectory <code>&lt;blog-n&gt;</code>
is</p>
<pre><code>.
├── index.html
└── src.md</code></pre>
<p><code>src.md</code> contains the full content of a blogpost, written
in markdown. <code>index.html</code> is identical across blog posts and
contains no specialized content; it exists simply to contain the results
of converting <code>src.md</code> to html, which is performed with the
<a href="https://md-block.verou.me/"><code>md-block.js</code></a>
library.</p>
<p>Why this approach? Writing markdown feels much more natural to me
than writing html, and even though I have to include the same
boilerplate html file in every blog post directory, it is mentally
cheaper than switching the whole site over to a templating engine that
generates the whole site from a set of markdown files. (It is also
cheaper than writing my own markdown-to-html converter, however tempting
that was…)</p>
<h3 id="project-subdirectories">Project subdirectories</h3>
<p>The structure of each project subdirectory
<code>&lt;project-n&gt;</code> depends on the type of project, as many
projects are not hosted directly on the site at all: some link out to
external repositories or sites, etc.</p>
<p>That said, for a common type of project that I’ve been building
lately, namely, self-contained creative coding sketches, the structure
looks like:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── index.html
└── sketch.js</code></pre>
<p>where the index contains no little specialized content except a
description of the project, and the content of the sketch lives in
<code>sketch.js</code>.</p>
<p>This structure has made it trivially easy to transfer javascript
sketches to this site from sandbox environments like the <a
href="https://editor.p5js.org/"><code>p5.js</code></a> editor.</p>
<h2 id="site-hosting-and-deployment">Site hosting and deployment</h2>
<p>I build, host, and deploy the site using <a
href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Thanks, GitHub! You
can look at the <a
href="https://github.com/hannahilea/hannahilea.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/static.yml">GitHub
Action</a> I use to deploy, but there is nothing custom or personal
about it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-new-content">Adding new content</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, well, if the blog and project subdirectories
all have similar structures, it would probably be easy to auto-setup new
blog posts and/or projects. And you would be correct! (That was, in
fact, one of the reasons I did it this way. :))</p>
<p>The top-level <a
href="https://github.com/hannahilea/hannahilea.github.io/blob/main/add_stuff.jl"><code>add_stuff.jl</code></a>
file is a commandline Julia script that (1) generates a new
subdirectory, based on files in the corresponding
<code>__template</code> subdirectory; (2) adds it to the relevant list
in the corresponding project/blog index.html; and (3) (in the case of
blogs) adds it to the rss feed. (Okay, this last item isn’t actually
implemented yet, but it will be shortly.)</p>
<p>Setting up the script and templates was relatively easy, and has made
adding new content to the site downright delightful. (“Delight” may be a
strong word, but the less overhead and wordsmithing I have to deal with
in order to post content to my site, the more likely that said content
will get posted at all…)</p>
<p>Why is the script in Julia? Because I like Julia, and I find it easy
to read/write.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all, folks!</h2>
<p>The structure of this site has evolved slightly since I first set it
up, and may evolve further, but for now I’m in a state where both goals
(trivially easy to set up, trivially easy to update) are met, as evinced
by the fact that I have fairly consistently added <a
href="../../projects">projects</a> to the site as I’ve built them! 🎉
Will this site structure work out longer-term? Time will tell! But at
least it exists (!) publicly (!!) right now (!!!).</p>
<p>As I borrowed (with permission!) when first assembling this site,
please feel free to borrow from me. It doesn’t seem worthwhile to turn
the whole site into a template itself (yet?!), but I could be convinced
otherwise if you reach out to let me know that you’re interested.</p>
<p>And finally if you, erstwhile reader, are a Web Person™ who thinks
I’ve made an egregious error in approach or wants to propose some
additional tweaks/improvements, do let me know!</p>
