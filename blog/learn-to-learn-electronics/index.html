      <h1>Learning to learn how to play with electronics</h1>
      <div class="date">20 Nov 2025</div>
<p><em>Over the past few years I’ve finally learned how to build
hardware and electronics projects in earnest, and am having fun doing
so—after too many years of frustration and struggles in getting started
even <em>learning how to learn</em> those skills.</em> <em>Here are some
thoughts around what I’ve learned from this journey. They were initially
written in response to a peer’s query, and are only lightly edited from
that initial brain dump. I may turn them into a cleaner narrative in the
future, I may not! Something something better a scrappy post than no
post? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</em></p>
<p><em>The initial writing of this list was time-boxed; I have a lot of
additional thoughts and caveats for basically every single point here,
but I am not allowing myself to add them or I’d <strong>never</strong>
be able to hit publish and move on to something else. If you, fair
reader, have a question about any specific point, ask and I’ll
elucidate!</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Before getting into hardware, I had a basic software engineering
skill set, general interest in wanting to understand ✨ anything ✨
about building my own hardware projects, and lots of frustration around
not knowing how to scale my ambitions to a learning process that would
actually help me…learn.</p>
<ul>
<li>I also had a lot of frustration, as over the years I’d taken various
stabs at trying to work with electronics and never really gotten far
enough to be able to feel like I was making progress or having fun.
E.g., various of one-off tutorials or “components kits” etc, which were
good in their own ways but did not help me learn how to learn.
And—unlike when learning various programming things—I did not find the
internet to be a particularly useful assistant. It was (and is!) full of
seas of tutorials and project write-ups and explanations that didn’t
quite meet me at my current skill state. Not the least of which is that
I didn’t have the skills to effectively assess a useful vs a half-baked
explanation. Intimidating <em>and</em> unhelpful!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hardware is a weird beast, if you’re mostly used to software—the
debugging process is similar in approach but wildly different in terms
of implementation/predictability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More on this some other time, perhaps, but unlike software, you
can’t save some functional state and just jump back to it at any
moment….you have to wire stuff, and sometimes (often 🙃) it is those
literal wired connections that are failing—for a variety of reasons that
may be straight-forward but take time to internalize.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>My intuition around what will take the most time in a hardware
project has been WILDLY off. I am still figuring out how to calibrate my
expectations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The thing that gave me enough technical support to get started with
electronics projects in earnest was having a safety-net
resource—someone(s) who could say “yes you are on the right path” and
“huh, that IS weird, here’s how I’d debug it” and “hrm, that seems a
little ambitious as a starting point, but if you do just this sub-part,
that seems doable!”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For me that initial safety-net
resource was my now-spouse, and it has grown to include a
former-housemate friend and the <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center (RC)</a> community at
large.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another important piece for me has been gaining intuition around how
other people approach projects, what types of components they use, what
they treat as easy and hard, what items they build themselves vs
purchase, etc. For this, I have found Instagram really useful—I follow a
bunch of maker people. Ditto the RSS feeds of maker blogs.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>There are lots of ways to connect components to microcontrollers:
breadboards, soldering to wires, soldering to prototyping boards,
designing a custom PCB. Each is fiddly in its own way. That’s okay!
Recognize that most tutorials will gloss right over the “connect
components to microcontroller” part, and so you’ll need to get
comfortable planning extra time for it until you’re practiced in
whichever approaches you prefer. Currently, I use breadboards and then
solder to prototyping boards.</p>
<ul>
<li>I recognize that there is an implicit shopping list associated with
hardware projects, and for beginners it won’t necessarily be clear what
is worth purchasing. To start with, buy as little as possible—try to
borrow tools from friends or try them out at your local makerspace.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meta-strategies">Meta-strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve found it REALLY helpful to take careful notes while I’m
doing anything with electronics—because then I don’t have to start from
scratch the next time I want to do something similar—in 6 days, 6
months, whatever—and also because it helps me figure out how to explain
to someone else what I’ve done when I’m asking them for help. Yes, this
can be true for software work, but it has been extra important for
hardware projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve had good luck live-blogging my experience in RC’s Zulip.
This has been helpful for things like “solidarity” and “motivation”, but
also for actual problem solving. Selfishly, I love it when other people
live-blog their experiences as well. If you need a tiny reason to push
you towards learning generously by writing your notes “publicly”—in a
blog, in the RC Zulip, etc—instead of in a private doc, feel free to use
“Hannah will probably read it and feel happy”!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>NB: Obviously the RC Zulip is specific to other folks in the RC
community, but if you don’t have a community or website to write to yet,
consider using something like <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tinylogger.com/">TinyLogger</a> for documenting your
learning process.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer: the following is primarily geared towards learning to
make projects like the ones I like, namely, some amount of hardware,
some amount of software, probably some doofy un-serious end-goal. If you
want to learn low-level electronic circuit stuff, the following may not
be quite what you want.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For getting started, growing your skillset, and really learning,
<strong>it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> all the
way down.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Start in the learning/tutorial section of the <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=music">Adafruit</a> website
and search for things you find interesting: music, sports, wearables,
gaming, whatever. Click on any project that even slightly catches your
eye, skim the first page of its write-up. If you don’t understand most
of what’s being discussed, that’s okay. Skim it anyway, then move on and
skim another project. By the time you’ve skimmed a handful of projects,
you’ll start recognizing terms that show up regularly. Look those up,
write down what they mean in that “scratch notes” document you’re
keeping. We’re going for osmosis here, not total comprehension.</p></li>
<li><p>Squint at these projects through a lens of how they can be
adapted to things you are curious about. At the time I’m writing this
list, there’s a bunch of halloween stuff. I have no interest in making
spooky props…but I would actually like to learn how to control large
outdoor displays, so <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dancing-inflatables-make-your-holiday-display-move">this
tutorial</a> on “Make your Holiday Display Move” is still interesting to
me. Skim it!</p></li>
<li><p>Pick one Adafruit microcontroller board to play with. Anything
you learn on one of these boards WILL be transferable to any other
Adafruit board…and then, likely, to other types of microcontrollers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062">Adafruit
Feathers</a> are great, although you’ll need to purchase sensors and
inputs separately, and you’ll probably need to do some soldering. This
is the flavor of board I first got comfortable with, and I really really
like it.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333">Circuit
Playground Express</a> is also great, both because Adafruit (and the
internet at large) has a lot of good documentation on how to hook it up
to different types of sensors (digital! analog! button! temperature!
etc), and because it has various capabilities built in so you can get a
feel for working with those inputs/outputs in code without having to
first wire them up. Also, you can use <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5592">alligator clips</a> to
connect components to them, rather than needing to solder, if you aren’t
ready to take on soldering as a skill.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you use an Adafruit board, you can program it in <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://circuitpython.org/">CircuitPython</a>, which is basically
Python with a set of hardware-tailored libraries that make working with
Adafruit boards straightforward. If you are used to Python in any
capacity, this is a great way to start thinking conceptually about how
to talk with the various inputs/outputs on your board. Once you’re
comfortable with the board/inputs, you can shift to some lower-level
language if you want, but also, you don’t have to! I’ve gotten
relatively far with CircuitPython for my current projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skill-building">Skill building</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The “hello-world” of hardware is “make light blink”.</p></li>
<li><p>Add skills one at a time, and don’t try to do it all at
once—unless you are following a well-written tutorial that includes all
the steps.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, I’ve intentionally attempted no more than ~1 new
hardware component type per project, especially if I’m using a board
that I haven’t tried before. This “slow” build has really helped me gain
confidence in learning <em>how to learn</em> about each new board, each
new component, and each new software library for interfacing with the
components.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to work with each of the following hardware
components, in roughly this order, has helped unlock a world confidence
and competence both:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digital inputs, e.g., buttons—toggle buttons, momentary buttons,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital outputs, e.g., an LED: from code, turn light on! Turn
light off! Etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Analog inputs, e.g., potentiometers—which can take the form of
knobs or sliders or touch sensors, or any number of other sensors, like
temperature or humidity or…. Go to Adafruit and search
“potentiometer”!</p></li>
<li><p>Neopixels! Turn lights on, make lights turn colors. This is my
latest component skill, I am very pleased about it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I have not yet tackled batteries! Or relays, or motors, or sound, or
a whole bunch of other stuff that is on my list. One thing at a
time!</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it has been useful to intentionally and slowly build
on software concepts for interacting with the components. I followed <a
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-hid-keyboard-buttons-with-circuitpython/ble-keyboard-buttons">an
Adafruit tutorial</a> to use an Adafruit Feather as a bluetooth
keyboard/mouse, and it has unlocked a huge amount of project potential
and gotten a lot of use for various projects.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Once you can connect your board to your computer as a “generic input”
then you can use any sort of sensor to trigger any sort of on-computer
task you want.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Browse the Adafruit store, especially the components section, and
pick one thing that looks REALLY FUN to you. Then figure out how to do
the most basic thing with it! They’ll often link to a tutorial page from
a product page.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are ordering parts for a specific project? Add on one or
two cheap fun-looking components, just for the fun of it. They’ll become
inspiration for a future project—ou never know when you’ll find a use
for that satisfyingly clicky toggle button!<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you are working through this slow-ish and steady-ish
regimen for projects you design yourself, you can still tackle larger
kits that involve More Stuff™ all at once; I’ve found that those help
practice similar critical thinking skills, even though I don’t
necessarily learn transferable hardware skills from them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g., I assembled a <a href="../ly-drawbot-setup/">kit for a pen
plotter</a>, which was really fun; even though it involved servos and
motors, though, I don’t feel like I understand how to fit those into my
own projects, because I didn’t actually think through how to assemble
them: I just followed the instructions for how to connect them to other
pre-programmed parts.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a bunch of cool kits out there; if these are your
speed, great. I find them really cool, and love the meditative aspect of
soldering stuff together. I have found them to be a fun activity but not
necessarily a great learning tool for me. Still, the fun is the point,
and getting practice handling components and doing soldering is still
worthwhile, so I’d recommend ’em if you’re even remotely
interested.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pep-talk">Pep talk</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Playing with electronics and building hardware projects is <em>so
fun</em>. I highly recommend it!!</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding how hardware projects are constructed is
satisfying, even if you aren’t making them yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Soldering is really fun!</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing what microcontroller to use can feel overwhelming. If you
get yourself comfortable with just a single board—e.g., one of those
Adafruit ones—this will start feeling less overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Even “basic” stuff—one button, etc—is satisfying to build and
play with. Monkey brain loves hitting button!! Button make light
go!</p></li>
<li><p>Once you start to get the hang of it, you’ll feel seriously
empowered. For example, here’s a relatively basic project I was able to
throw together recently, which I would not have been able to do easily
even a year ago: <a href="../button-box-timer/">Button-box
timer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In my experience, some combination of the microcontrollers
themselves, the programming environments created for them, and the
documentation for both have gotten way better over time. If you
attempted electronics previously and gave up in frustration, it’s worth
trying again today: there’s a lot more (and a lot better) documentation
out there now than there used to be.</p></li>
<li><p>There is <em>so</em> much documentation out there for “getting
started with hardware” / “learning to do electronics”, etc, and it can
be intimidating—not least of which because there are some pretty big
leaps in assumption about what a “beginner” already knows. This post
included! Don’t let this discourage you. :)</p></li>
