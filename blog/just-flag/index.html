      <h1>The “just” flag: A conversational harbinger of things to come 🚩</h1>
      <div class="date">16 Oct 2025</div>
      <p>Many years ago, after a particularly spicy meeting of our cross-functional engineering team, a teammate-friend noted to me that “whenever someone uses the word”just”, he takes it as a sign that</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>“Just” flag</strong>: A phrase referencing the fact that the word “just” often signifies that any complexities in the item under discussion are being ignored.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Corollary: When the word “just” shows up in an instruction from someone, it is worth thinking extra carefully about the task at hand before agreeing to it. efefe</p>
      <p>
        Learning to recognize the use of this flag in your own speech and that of the people around you will help you build a more accurate understanding of the context around you—and will make you a more empathatic person, by helping you
        recognize when you might be inadvertently minimizing something to the people around you.
      </p>
      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p>Q: Should I not use the word “just”? Are you saying it’s a bad word??</p>
      <p>
        A: Not at all, not even a little!! It’s a great word. I’m saying that it carries a weight that you might not intend, so by recognizing when you’re using it you’ll be better able to make sure you’re communicating what you mean to be
        communicating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if you teach the people around you about ““just” flag”, you’ll be able to intentionally signify that you’re glossing over things that you <em>know</em> aren’t necessarily trivial, but just aren’t an immediate priority
        to hash out.
      </p>
      <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
      <p>
        When do I use the phrase “just flag”? Also, I hate to say it, but I do often—unfortunately!—stylize with airquotes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>ANYWAY. Let’s look at some examples to illustrate the utility of “just flag” recognition:</p>
      <p>Conversation with junior me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Person A: “To accomplish that task, you just need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”</li>
        <li>
          Me:
          <ul>
            <li>Attempts to fwee the scrim. Looks up how to fwee the scrim.</li>
            <li>Feels frustrated, feels bad, since obviously everyone else knows how to fwee that scrim. How do I not know this already? Why is this taking me so long?</li>
            <li>Three days later, goes back to person A and asks for clarification—seems like the fwee is unscrimmable, since we don’t have access to the fwee-lock due to a configuration that is out of our control.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Person A: Oh yeah, I guess that IS complicated. Hmm. Let’s think it through together.</li>
        <li>Me: Relieved but also exhausted from having gone through a shame spiral.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Conversation with me after I started thinking in terms of the “just flag”:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Person A: “To accomplish that task, you just need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”</li>
        <li>I’m not sure what exactly you mean by fweeing the scrim here? Like, I know what those words mean in general, but can we talk about how that would fit with our current system?</li>
        <li>Person A: well you just…oh hmm…okay yeah, it’s not quite that trivial. let’s think about it!</li>
        <li>Person A alternate: oh yeah, there wouldn’t have been a reason for you to know this yet, but Team B implemented a config change so making this fix is truly as straight-forward as signing onto ___ and hitting this button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Same conversation after teaching my team the phrase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Person A: “To accomplish that task, you [airquotes] just [airquotes] need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”
          <ul>
            <li>
              Me: laughs. Okay, cool. Assuming we’ve fweed the shim, are we sure that we’re on the right track for the end state? …and then we can have a conversation about whether the approach is solid, rather than the specifics of how to
              do it, both knowing that the act of scrim fweeing may require some effort, but that we don’t necessarily need to discuss the implementation details immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="style-guide">Style guide</h2>
      <p>In person:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saying “just flag” either in the middle of a sentence or after completing the thought.</li>
        <li>Putting airquotes around “just” when I say the word.</li>
        <li>Using a doofy voice modulation when I say the word “just” and emphasizing it to indicate that it is both intentional and internally non-trivial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Putting the word ‘just’ in quotes when I use it: ““Just” paint the shed”</li>
        <li>Putting the word inside colons (<code>:just-flag:</code>) because that’s the emoji shortcut in Slack. (I only use this in conversation with former team-friends who have the same context as I do)</li>
        <li>Calling it out afterwards. “Just paint the shed. (”Just”-flag)”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the workplace:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a <code>:just-flag:</code> emoji to the slack workspace and using it tounge-in-cheek in my own posts</li>
        <li>
          Using it as a reaction to posts <em>made by people at or above my career stage</em> if I know that those people are also aware of its meaning.
          <ul>
            <li>Important: only when it is going to be clear to the both of us (plus onlookers) that it is a friendly call-out. No punching down!!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Using it as a reaction to posts made by other people where THEY’VE included it (tongue-in-cheek) on their own posts
          <ul>
            <li>:spiderman meme: heyyyyy we both agree that this is a known oversimplification</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s a lil’ emoji if you’d like to add it to your {slack/discord/zulip/whatever} messaging system:</p>
