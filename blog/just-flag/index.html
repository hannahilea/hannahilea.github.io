      <h1>The “just” Flag: A sign of minimization 🚩</h1>
      <div class="date">18 Dec 2025</div>
      <p>
        Many years ago, after a particularly spicy meeting of our cross-functional engineering team, a teammate-friend noted to me that whenever someone uses the word “just” he takes it as a sign that the speaker probably hasn’t spent much
        time thinking about the complexities of the thing they’re proposing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>His astute observation stuck with me: I have taken to calling it the “Just” Flag, teaching teammates (and friends) about it, and using it constantly to recognize—and avoid!—inadvertent minimizations in my own communication.</p>
      <p>Specifically,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>The “Just” Flag</strong> is recognition of use of the word “just” and the high likelihood of its use glossing over complexities in the item under discussion.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The “Just” Flag itself—and the use of the word “just” in general!— is morally neutral and has no inherent virtue: there is nothing good or bad about using the word “just” or in calling out its useage. The goal is to recognize that
        it often does set an unintended contextual tone, such that recognizing it in yourself and others can help you be better and kinder in your own speech, and request appropriate clarification from others who’ve used it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Corollary: When the word “just” shows up in an instruction from someone, it is worth thinking extra carefully about the task at hand before agreeing to it.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Learning to recognize the Just Flag in your own speech and that of the people around you will help you build a more accurate understanding of the context around you. Specifically, it can help you recognize when you might be
        inadvertently minimizing something to the people around you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sidebar: I can’t figure out a consistent way to write about it: The just flag? The Just Flag? The “just” flag? The “Just” Flag? :shrug:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p>Q: Should I not use the word “just”? Are you saying it’s a bad word??</p>
      <p>
        A: Not at all, not even a little!! It’s a great word. I’m saying that it carries a weight that you might not intend, so by recognizing when you’re using it you’ll be better able to make sure you’re communicating what you mean to be
        communicating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if you teach the people around you about ““just” flag”, you’ll be able to intentionally signify to each other that you’re conversationally glossing over something that you <em>suspect</em> isn’t trivial, but not because
        you’re questioning each other’s intelligence.
      </p>
      <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
      <p>
        When do I use the phrase “just flag”? Also, I hate to say it, but I do often—unfortunately!—stylize it with airquotes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>ANYWAY. Let’s look at some examples to illustrate the utility of “just flag” recognition:</p>
      <p>Conversation with junior me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Person A: “To accomplish that task, you just need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”</li>
        <li>
          Me:
          <ul>
            <li>Attempts to fwee the scrim. Looks up how to fwee the scrim.</li>
            <li>Feels frustrated, feels bad, since obviously everyone else knows how to fwee that scrim. How do I not know this already? Why is this taking me so long?</li>
            <li>Three days later, goes back to person A and asks for clarification—seems like the fwee is unscrimmable, since we don’t have access to the fwee-lock due to a configuration that is out of our control.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Person A: Oh yeah, I guess that IS complicated. Hmm. Let’s think it through together.</li>
        <li>Me: Relieved but also exhausted from having gone through a shame spiral.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Conversation with me after I started thinking in terms of the “just flag”:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Person A: “To accomplish that task, you just need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”</li>
        <li>I’m not sure what exactly you mean by fweeing the scrim here? Like, I know what those words mean in general, but can we talk about how that would fit with our current system?</li>
        <li>Person A: well you just…oh hmm…okay yeah, it’s not quite that trivial. let’s think about it!</li>
        <li>Person A alternate: oh yeah, there wouldn’t have been a reason for you to know this yet, but Team B implemented a config change so making this fix is truly as straight-forward as signing onto ___ and hitting this button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Same conversation after teaching my team the phrase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Person A: “To accomplish that task, you [airquotes] just [airquotes] need to fwee the scrim, then you’ll be able to build the thing that we’ve agreed on.”
          <ul>
            <li>
              Me: laughs. Okay, cool. Assuming we’ve fweed the shim, are we sure that we’re on the right track for the end state? …and then we can have a conversation about whether the approach is solid, rather than the specifics of how to
              do it, both knowing that the act of scrim fweeing may require some effort, but that we don’t necessarily need to discuss the implementation details immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="style-guide">Style guide</h2>
      <p>In person:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saying “just flag” either in the middle of a sentence or after completing the thought.</li>
        <li>Putting airquotes around “just” when I say the word.</li>
        <li>Using a doofy voice modulation when I say the word “just” and emphasizing it to indicate that it is both intentional and internally non-trivial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Putting the word ‘just’ in quotes when I use it: ““Just” paint the shed”</li>
        <li>Putting the word inside colons (<code>:just-flag:</code>) because that’s the emoji shortcut in Slack. (I only use this in conversation with former team-friends who have the same context as I do)</li>
        <li>Calling it out afterwards. “Just paint the shed. (”Just”-flag)”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the workplace:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a <code>:just-flag:</code> emoji to the slack workspace and using it tounge-in-cheek in my own posts</li>
        <li>
          Using it as a reaction to posts <em>made by people at or above my career stage</em> if I know that those people are also aware of its meaning.
          <ul>
            <li>Important: only when it is going to be clear to the both of us (plus onlookers) that it is a friendly call-out. No punching down!!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Using it as a reaction to posts made by other people where THEY’VE included it (tongue-in-cheek) on their own posts
          <ul>
            <li>:spiderman meme: heyyyyy we both agree that this is a known oversimplification</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s a lil’ emoji if you’d like to add it to your {slack/discord/zulip/whatever} messaging system:</p>

              Due to the vagaries of time, I don’t remember his precise wording—I do, however, remember that it was delivered in a conversationally neutral and off-hand manner, and was an admirably diplomatic take of an otherwise
              infuriating meeting. I have been attempting to match this sardonic delivery every since.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              I know, I know, this is SO uncool. Unfortunately, it is also useful. It’s a little <del>more</del> less uncool if you do your air quotes using
              <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table">non-English quotation mark symbols</a>, e.g., „German“ or « French », etc. Suffice it to say, you will look and
              feel <em>exceptionally</em> cool making these quotes in the air. And of course, I am an excellent judge of coolness. 😇<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
