<p><em>For the last week I‚Äôve been recovering from a medical thing,
which has involved very little Doing and a whole lot of Resting‚Ñ¢‚Äîin my
doctor‚Äôs words, I‚Äôm only supposed to be doing ‚Äúthe activities of daily
living.‚Äù Easier said than done! It‚Äôs pretty weird to feel mentally fine
but physically exhausted, which is different than my typical
brain-plus-body exhaustion when ill.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I‚Äôve done a fair bit of media consumption during this
time, and now that I have a bit more energy it feels like a good time
for a link dump!</em></p>

<li><p><strong>Video game <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.albawildlife.com/">Alba:
A Wildlife Adventure</a></strong></p>
<p>You are a young girl visiting your grandparents on their
Mediterranean island for the week. You run around taking photos of
birds, cleaning up trash, and advocating for environmental
restoration.</p>
<p>It is beautiful and calming to look at and listen to, and easy to
play. This was my second time through, and it was just as delightful as
the first. If you are a person who doesn‚Äôt consider themselves a game
person, Alba may change your mind. (h/t DK)</p></li>

<p>This game is the daily bane of my existence, in a good way. Every
day, there‚Äôs a new Wikipedia page to identify, word by grueling word.
The healthy way to play is to stop when you‚Äôve guessed the Wikipedia
page. Or you can keep going to try to guess <em>all</em> the words. üôÉ
Luckily, there‚Äôs only one new entry to guess every 24 hours? (h/t

<p>I have not actually played this yet, but want to‚Äîand I haven‚Äôt been
able to stop thinking about it. I mean, it opens like
<strong>this</strong>! I dare <em>you</em> to be able to stop thinking
about it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are a Flock of Ungrateful Forest Chickadees</strong>
<br><br> You are also know-it-alls of the highest caliber. Animals
gather from all over to ask you their most burning questions. What
wisdom will you bestow upon them? <br><br> This is a larp for one flock
of chickadees. A flock is usually 3 to 18 birds, most of which are
chickadees but might also include a few other small social birds, such
as nuthatches, woodpeckers, or warblers. The larp is meant to run for 30
minutes to a few hours at most, depending on how many questions you
answer. No additional materials are required to play. <br><br> Play
consists of making your chickadees, doing a workshop to practice your
chickadee moves, playing several scenes where you‚Äôll answer questions,
then wrapping with a short debrief. Read these instructions aloud as you
work through the larp.</p>

<p>I really appreciate Victoria‚Äôs take, drawn from experience as both a
software engineer and an artist. A few favorite excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I offer, then, a crude heuristic: I believe that the decisions you
make in your drawing ‚Äì conscious and unconscious ‚Äì are the vehicle by
which your soul, or aliveness, or intention, or WHATEVER, is infused in
your creation. And I believe you need to make the vast majority of the
decisions that compose a piece of art for you to claim it as your
own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you lie to my face and I believe you, does the lie somehow become
‚Äúvalid‚Äù because I‚Äôm fooled by it? <br><br> I‚Äôm saying that even if I
<em>can‚Äôt tell</em> that the world around me is a mirage, <em>I do not
want to live in a mirage.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I‚Äôm in the beginnings of a new tech-oriented research project,
I‚Äôm getting a lot from Ursula Franklin‚Äôs ‚ÄúReal World of Technology‚Äù
lectures, which contain the following checklist for projects: <br>
<em>‚Äú‚Ä¶ whether it:</em> <br> <em>(1) promotes justice;</em><br>
<em>(2) restores reciprocity;</em><br> <em>(3) confers divisible or
indivisible benefits;</em><br> <em>(4) favours people over
machines;</em><br> <em>(5) whether its strategy maximizes gain or
minimizes disaster;</em><br> <em>(6) whether conservation is favoured
over waste; and</em><br> <em>(7), whether the reversible is favoured
over the irreversible?‚Äù</em><br></p>

haven‚Äôt yet listened to them myself, but they‚Äôre on my list!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online handbook <a

<p>Welcome to <em>The Turing Way</em> handbook to reproducible, ethical
and collaborative data science. <br> [‚Ä¶] <br> <em>The Turing Way</em>
community is dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent
research ‚Äútoo easy not to do‚Äù. That means investing in the

<li>a community</li>
<li>a global collaboration</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I haven‚Äôt read all of it yet, but the bits I have read are great, and
it seems like a good primer for anyone working a job that involves
data‚Äîanalysis, model training, etc‚Äîand <em>especially</em> for those of
us who didn‚Äôt go through engineering schools with ‚Äúengineering ethics‚Äù
coursework. If I were assembling a research or engineering team, I think
portions of this handbook would be suggested reading.</p>
