## Listen/watch

- **The musical *[Death Becomes Her](https://deathbecomesher.com/)***

    I have not seen this in person. I also have not seen the movie that it is based on. What I *have* done is listen to the soundtrack on repeat, with an emphasis on song *The Plan*, which I listen to on single-song repeat when I get tired of listening to the whole album.[^okay]

    [^okay]: Are things okay in my head these days? Yes, I think so? Wait, why do you ask??

    For a sense of the plot, start with the cast's performance on Tiny Desk Concert:

        title="YouTube video player"

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

    Or jump directly to Ernest Making A Planâ„¢:

## Read/listen

- **Malka Ann Older's *[The Mimicking of Known Successes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784309-the-mimicking-of-known-successes)* (novella)**

    Sherlock Holmes vibes, set on a cozy albeit atmospherically challenging Jupiter. The Holmes character is played by the inimitable Mossa, a no-nonsense Investigator who pulls in Pleiti---her Watson---to help with a case. This is---naturally---due to Pleiti's academic specialty in Classics, i.e., studying Earth ecosystems in the time before Earth became uninhabitable, and not at all due to any other reasons at all.[^lurve] 

    [^lurve] Certainly not *lurve*...

    This was a pleasingly cozy ~~~read~~~ listen[^listen] I don't often enjoy murder mysteries these days, but Older's world building is so pleasing that I didn't mind it. Everyone travels in railcars and lives along rings in the planet's upper atmosphere?? Children's literature read and analyzed for their ecological descriptions?! Also, scones.

    [^listen]: The audiobook narration was additionally charming.
