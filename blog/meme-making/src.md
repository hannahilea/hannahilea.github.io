...so that you can quickly make

- motivational quote images!
- custom Zulip/Slack emojis!
- common meme templates!
- goofy “photoshop” composites!
- ...whatever your heart desires!

Loosely adapted from a non-programming talk given while at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

## Taking screenshots quickly

## Make motivational quotes

## Make traditional templated memes

## Create emoji for Slack/Zulip/etc

## Create "Photoshop" composite images

## With great power comes great responsibility!

1. Respect assumptions of privacy, e.g., no Zoom screenshot sharing (of people, slides, the chat) without their permission.

2. Be respectful in your choice of meme templates/imagery. Avoid the -isms, inadvertent microaggressions, and TODO.


***Thanks to TODO.***
