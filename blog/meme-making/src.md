...so that you can quickly make

- motivational quote images! [>iefef⤵️](#motivational-quotes)
- custom Zulip/Slack emojis! [⤵️](#emojis)
- common meme templates! [⤵️](#popular-meme-templates)
- goofy “photoshop” composites! [⤵️](#photoshop-composites)
- ...whatever your heart desires!  [⤵️](#motivational-quotes)

TODO-make meme image for this place

Loosely adapted from a non-programming talk given while at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

## Taking screenshots quickly

If you learn one thing from this post, it should be how to take a screenshot of a selected region on your computer. 

<alert> This approach is specific to desktop computers; I'm going to let you look up the specifics for how to do it on phone. </alert> TODO-fix this formatting

TODO-insert table!

Homework! Right now (yes, right now!):

- [ ] Save a screenshot of this slide to a file 
- [ ] Save a screenshot of this slide to your clipboard, then paste it (ctrl+v) somewhere else: a new email message, a text message to your landlord, Slack, wherever!
TODO-don't always disable checkboxes


## Make motivational quotes

## Make traditional templated memes

## Create emoji for Slack/Zulip/etc

## Create "Photoshop" composite images

## With great power comes great responsibility!

1. Respect assumptions of privacy, e.g., no Zoom screenshot sharing (of people, slides, the chat) without their permission.

2. Be respectful in your choice of meme templates/imagery. Avoid the -isms, inadvertent microaggressions, and TODO.


***Thanks to TODO.***
